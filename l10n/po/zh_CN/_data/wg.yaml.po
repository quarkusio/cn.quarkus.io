"<h3>1. Summary</h3>\n"
"<p>This working group will explore and define the foundation of the next generation of <strong>AI-Infused</strong> and <strong>Agentic applications</strong> built with LangChain4j and Quarkus LangChain4j. The group will investigate core changes to the current programming model, improve developer experience, build stronger interoperability mechanisms (especially around A2A), and define architectural separation of responsibilities (e.g., executor vs planner). The output will serve as the foundation for building resilient, scalable, and extensible AI-infused and agent systems on the Quarkus platform.</p>\n"
"<h3>2. Motivation</h3>\n"
"<p>While LangChain4j and Quarkus LangChain4j already provide strong foundations, building real-world agentic applications has revealed several pain points and architectural limitations. These range from ergonomic and modeling issues to missing runtime support for observability, visualization, memory management, and resilience.</p>\n"
"<p>This WG aims to:</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>streamline the developer experience,</li>\n"
"<li>improve core primitives (invocations, workflows, A2A),</li>\n"
"<li>enable pluggable planning <em>engines</em> (like the built-in workflow constructs, supervisor…),</li>\n"
"<li>strengthen memory and context engineering support,</li>\n"
"<li>and provide around cost, observability, and correctness features</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<h3>3. Scope</h3>\n"
"<p>This working group will cover the following areas:</p>\n"
"<p><strong>Developer Model Simplification</strong></p>\n"

"</ul>\n"
"<p>⠀\n"
"<strong>Invocation Model Enhancements</strong></p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>Rename <code>AgentInvocation</code> to <code>Invocation</code> to enable invocations of regular methods/tools</li>\n"

"<li>Improve human in the loop and agent conversation support</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p>⠀\n"
"<strong>A2A (Agent-to-Agent) Improvements</strong></p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>Automatic exposure of agents as A2A services</li>\n"
"<li>Declarative A2A clients</li>\n"
"<li>Studies how A2A agents can be integrated into applications (what are the patterns?)</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p>⠀\n"
"<strong>Architectural Refactoring</strong></p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>Apply Autonomic Reference Architecture: clear separation between operational/execution execution (observe, act, maintain state) and analytical planning (decide, select following invocation)</li>\n"
"<li>Design for pluggable planners (rules, workflows, LLM-based (supervisor))</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p>⠀\n"
"<strong>LangChain4j Core Improvements</strong></p>\n"
"<ul>\n"

"</ul>\n"
"</li>\n"
"<li>Build-time validation for LangChain4j constructs (missing tools, bad metadata, etc.)</li>\n"
"<li>Evaluation harnesses and support for repeatable agent test scenarios</li>\n"

"<h3>4. Out of Scope</h3>\n"
"<p>This working group does <strong>not</strong> cover:</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>UI/UX or frontend agent interfaces beyond Dev UI integration</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p>⠀</p>\n"
"<h3>5. Definition of Done</h3>\n"
"<p>The WG will be considered <strong>done</strong> when the following milestones are met:</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>A simplified and more declarative developer model is available</li>\n"

"<li>Dev UI extension is available for invocation/workflow visualization</li>\n"
"<li>A2A support includes declarative clients and automatic exposure</li>\n"
"<li>Context engineering and memory management strategies are documented and implemented</li>\n"
"<li>Build-time validation and token usage observability are implemented</li>\n"

"<p>This working group was formed to address long-standing inconsistencies and pain points in the Dev Services lifecycle within Quarkus. Dev Services are essential for simplifying local development and testing by automatically provisioning runtime dependencies (e.g., databases, message brokers), but their current lifecycle behavior leads to confusion and inefficiencies. Most notably, they are started during the augmentation phase, which conflicts with their inherently runtime-oriented nature and causes issues with newer efforts such as the test classloading revamp.</p>\n"
"<p>The primary goal of this group is to define and implement a consistent, runtime-aligned lifecycle model for Dev Services. This includes shifting their startup to a phase after augmentation but before the application begins execution, ensuring better alignment with the runtime environment. A critical focus will also be on enabling optional reuse of Dev Services across dev and test modes — including reuse between repeated test executions — to reduce startup time and improve the iterative development experience.</p>\n"
"<p>The group's scope covers several strategic areas: formalizing when and how Dev Services are started, reused, or stopped; defining rules for discoverability and sharing between profiles or processes; and avoiding resource leaks or accidental retention. It explicitly excludes broader orchestration features (such as service dependency graphs) and unrelated feature enhancements.</p>\n"
"<p>The working group will produce a set of deliverables to support the new model. These include one or more Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) describing the new lifecycle model, the implementation of lifecycle logic in Quarkus Core, and updates to both user-facing and contributor documentation. Additionally, enhancements to the Dev Services development model will make it easier for extension authors to adopt and follow the new lifecycle standards. A public communication effort (e.g., blog posts or demos) will also be used to showcase the improvements.</p>\n"

"<p>At the moment, Quarkus tests are invoked using one classloader, and then executed in a different classloader. This mostly works well, but means some use cases don't work: extensions cannot manipulate test classes in the same way that they do normal application classes. For example, anything run via a JUnit @TestTemplate test case will see the un-transformed class.</p>\n"
"<p>It also means we have extra user-facing complexity, such as the QuarkusTest*Callbacks](https://quarkus.io/guides/getting-started-testing#enrichment-via-quarkustestcallback):</p>\n"
"<blockquote>\n"
"<p>While it is possible to use JUnit Jupiter callback interfaces like BeforeEachCallback, you might run into classloading issues because Quarkus has to run tests in a custom classloader which JUnit is not aware of.</p>\n"
"</blockquote>\n"
"<p>A final benefit is a reduction in the internal complexity of our code. Hopping between classloaders during test execution takes a lot of work, and adds a lot of code! It also is brittle in places. For example, because the hop between classloaders relies on serialization in some cases, it's becoming harder to do as the JVM tightens up security restrictions. We used to rely on xstream, but that stopped working in Java 17. In https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/40601, @dmlloyd moved us to use the JBoss Serializer, which works better, but might still be affected by future restrictions on class access.</p>\n"
"<p>The goal of this working group is to allow test classes to fully participate in the 'quarkification' of classes. The mechanism for this is probably just to load the test classes with the classloader we intend to run them with, so that JUnit sees the 'correct' version of the class.</p>\n"

"<p>最后一个好处是降低了代码的内部复杂性。在测试执行过程中，在类加载器之间跳来跳去会耗费大量工作，并增加大量代码！而且在某些地方还很脆弱。例如，由于类加载器之间的跳转在某些情况下依赖于序列化，随着 JVM 收紧安全限制，这种跳转变得越来越难。我们曾经依赖 xstream，但在 Java 17 中它已停止工作。在 https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/40601 中，@dmlloyd 让我们使用 JBoss Serializer，它的效果更好，但仍可能受到未来类访问限制的影响。</p>\n"

"<h2>Overview</h2>\n"
"<p>Observability.Next is a strategic initiative to modernize the observability stack within the Quarkus framework, aiming to streamline and enhance its ability to monitor and manage distributed systems. Currently, Quarkus (3.16.x) leverages the following components for observability:\n"
"Metrics: Managed through <a href=\"https://micrometer.io/\">Micrometer</a>, which supports multiple registries (e.g., Prometheus) to expose application metrics.\n"
"Tracing: Handled via the OpenTelemetry (OTEL) SDK, enabling distributed tracing data to be exported to an OTEL collector.\n"
"Logging: JBoss's LogManager with a handler forwarding logs with OTEL.</p>\n"
"<p>While OpenTelemetry is the industry standard for observability, both in protocol and format, the OTEL SDK has proven challenging to adapt due to its design for agent-based observability. In a framework like Quarkus, more granular and direct control over observability is required to monitor application performance, reliability, and user experience effectively.</p>\n"
"<p>Micrometer, the de-facto Java standard for metrics, has recently proposed an enhanced, global approach to observability with the new Observation API. Expanding Micrometer’s role in Quarkus’ observability stack represents an opportunity to simplify implementation and maintenance while preserving compatibility with leading observability tools.</p>\n"
"<h2>Objectives</h2>\n"
"<p>The Observability.Next initiative seeks to strengthen the integration of Micrometer’s evolving Observability API within Quarkus, aligning it with OpenTelemetry’s protocol standards. Key objectives include:</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>Enhanced Observability Control: Implement a framework-native, Micrometer-centric approach to metrics, traces, and logs, ensuring developers have more refined control over observability components without the limitations of the OTEL SDK.</li>\n"
"<li>Broader Metrics and Tracing Compatibility: Continue exposing metrics to various registries, including Prometheus, while maintaining OTEL compatibility for metrics and tracing protocols.\n"
"Improved Performance and Reliability: Define and measure performance baselines of the current observability setup and compare them against the next-to-be Micrometer Observation API and OTEL bridge integration to ensure tangible performance and reliability improvements.\n"
"Continue to support components using Micrometer metrics API or Open * Telemetry SDK (like Pulsar)</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<h2>Scope</h2>\n"
"<p>Observability.Next will unfold across multiple phases, each handled by specialised working groups. The scope of the initial working group will include:</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>Micrometer Observation API Integration: Introduce and integrate Micrometer’s observability API as a foundational layer</li>\n"
"<li>Transformation to OTEL Protocols: Develop a mechanism to translate Micrometer-collected observations into OTEL-compatible metrics, traces, and logs, ensuring smooth interoperability with OTEL-based tools and collectors.</li>\n"
"<li>Performance Benchmarking: Establish a performance baseline for Quarkus’ current observability model, comparing it against the new Micrometer-based observability API and OTEL bridge to quantify gains and identify areas for further optimisation.</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<h2>Expected Outcomes</h2>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li></li>\n"
"<li>Improved Developer Experience: More intuitive, refined control over observability for Quarkus developers, reducing complexity and overhead associated with setting up and maintaining observability.</li>\n"
"<li>Ecosystem Compatibility: Continued compatibility with existing observability tools such as Prometheus and OTEL collectors, ensuring interoperability with common enterprise monitoring solutions.</li>\n"
"<li>Less breakage due to the OTEL SDK</li>\n"
"<li>More control over the semantic convention in span and metric tags</li>\n"
"<li>Performance Gains: Potentially lower latency and resource consumption in observability operations, contributing to Quarkus’ goal of high-performance, cloud-native applications.</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p>Some concrete features we would get at the framework level:</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>Instrument once, plug different frameworks later</li>\n"
"<li>Better support of scopes than the one we have today. See:\n"
"https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/25102 and\n"
"https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/37140</li>\n"
"<li>Auto-generate metrics documentation from source code instrumented with it.</li>\n"
"<li>A way to manage semantic conventions</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p>Users would benefit from:</p>\n"

"<h2>概述</h2>\n"
"<p>Observability.Next是一项战略性计划，旨在更新Quarkus框架中的可观测性堆栈，以简化和增强其监控和管理分布式系统的能力。目前，Quarkus（3.16.x）利用以下组件实现可观察性：\n"
"度量：通过<a href=\"https://micrometer.io/\">Micrometer</a> 进行管理，它支持多个注册表（如 Prometheus）以公开应用指标。\n"
"跟踪：通过 OpenTelemetry (OTEL) SDK 处理，可将分布式跟踪数据导出到 OTEL 收集器。\n"
"日志记录JBoss 的日志管理器（LogManager）带有通过 OTEL 转发日志的处理程序。</p>\n"
"<p>虽然 OpenTelemetry 在协议和格式上都是可观察性的行业标准，但 OTEL SDK 却因其基于代理的可观察性设计而在适应性方面具有挑战性。在 Quarkus 这样的框架中，需要对可观测性进行更精细、更直接的控制，以有效监控应用程序的性能、可靠性和用户体验。</p>\n"
"<p>Micrometer 是事实上的 Java 度量标准，它最近通过新的观察 API 提出了一种增强型全局可观察性方法。扩大 Micrometer 在 Quarkus 可观察性堆栈中的作用是一个简化实施和维护的机会，同时还能保持与领先的可观察性工具的兼容性。</p>\n"
"<h2>目标</h2>\n"
"<p>Observability.Next 计划旨在加强 Quarkus 中 Micrometer 不断发展的 Observability API 的集成，使其与 OpenTelemetry 的协议标准保持一致。主要目标包括</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>增强可观察性控制：对指标、跟踪和日志实施以 Micrometer 为中心的原生框架方法，确保开发人员能够对可观察性组件进行更精细的控制，而不受 OTEL SDK 的限制。</li>\n"
"<li>更广泛的指标和跟踪兼容性：继续向包括 Prometheus 在内的各种注册中心公开度量指标，同时保持 OTEL 对度量指标和跟踪协议的兼容性。\n"
"提高性能和可靠性：定义和测量当前可观测性设置的性能基线，并与即将推出的 Micrometer Observation API 和 OTEL 桥接集成进行比较，以确保性能和可靠性得到切实提高。\n"
"继续支持使用 Micrometer 度量 API 或 Open * Telemetry SDK（如 Pulsar）的组件</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<h2>范围</h2>\n"
"<p>Observability.Next 将分多个阶段展开，每个阶段由专门的工作组负责。初始工作组的工作范围包括</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>Micrometer 观测应用程序接口集成：引入并整合 Micrometer 的可观测性 API 作为基础层</li>\n"
"<li>转换为 OTEL 协议：开发一种机制，将 Micrometer 收集的观测数据转换为与 OTEL 兼容的度量、轨迹和日志，确保与基于 OTEL 的工具和收集器顺利实现互操作。</li>\n"
"<li>性能基准：为 Quarkus 当前的可观测性模型建立性能基准，将其与新的基于 Micrometer 的可观测性 API 和 OTEL 桥接进行比较，以量化收益并确定需要进一步优化的领域。</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<h2>预期成果</h2>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li></li>\n"
"<li>改善开发人员体验：为 Quarkus 开发人员提供更直观、更完善的可观察性控制，降低与设置和维护可观察性相关的复杂性和开销。</li>\n"
"<li>生态系统兼容性：继续与 Prometheus 和 OTEL 收集器等现有可观察性工具兼容，确保与通用企业监控解决方案的互操作性。</li>\n"
"<li>减少因 OTEL SDK 而造成的故障</li>\n"
"<li>对跨度和度量标记中的语义约定有更多控制权</li>\n"
"<li>性能提升：在可观测性操作中可能会降低延迟和资源消耗，有助于实现 Quarkus 的高性能云原生应用目标。</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p>我们将在框架层面获得一些具体功能：</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>一次仪表化，稍后插入不同的框架</li>\n"
"<li>比现在更好的作用域支持。请参见\n"
"https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/25102 和\n"

"<h2>Motivation:</h2>\n"
"<p>Quarkus is now part of multiple product offerings (e.g., Red Hat Build of Quarkus, Camel integrations, ...). To enable tooling and automation to reflect product-specific support levels, we need to:</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>Extend the platform metadata with structured offering-level support indicators.</li>\n"
"<li>Adapt code.quarkus.io and code.quarkus.redhat.com to display and filter based on offering.</li>\n"
"<li>Plan for downstream use by the CLI, build tooling, and possibly SKU-based features.</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p>This working group ensures a coordinated effort across platform, metadata, and UI/UX teams to avoid fragmentation and deliver a coherent user experience.</p>\n"
"<h2>Goals:</h2>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>Define and adopt a standard metadata format for offering-level support annotations.</li>\n"
"<li>Apply metadata consistently across all productized platform descriptors.</li>\n"
"<li>Integrate offering awareness into code.quarkus.redhat.com:</li>\n"
"<li>Display per-offering support levels.</li>\n"
"<li>Allow filtering and navigation based on offering.</li>\n"
"<li>Ensure the upstream site (code.quarkus.io) remains offering-agnostic.</li>\n"
"<li>Evaluate CLI support for offering information</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<h2>Scope:</h2>\n"
"<p>In scope:</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>JSON platform descriptor enhancements</li>\n"
"<li>Tooling (code.quarkus.io/redhat.com) UI/UX changes</li>\n"
"<li>CLI enhancements (optional, pending feasibility)</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p>Out of scope:</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>\n"
"<p>Modifying Quarkus runtime behavior based on offering</p>\n"

"<p>from Discussion at https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/discussions/43013</p>\n"
"<p>We started the move of Quarkus to a foundation <a href=\"https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-in-a-foundation/\">earlier this year</a> and recently <a href=\"https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-moving-to-commonhaus/\">set the direction</a> towards <a href=\"https://www.commonhaus.org/\">CommonHaus</a> and during the summer break the CommonHaus council <a href=\"https://github.com/commonhaus/foundation/pull/183\">approved our request</a> to join.</p>\n"
"<p>Thus, now the real work starts, and it's just fitting we set up a working group for the effort getting Quarkus to CommonHaus foundation.</p>\n"
"<h1>Goal</h1>\n"
"<p>Two parts</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>setup Quarkus to have transparent and open governance</li>\n"
"<li>Go through the few but important requirements for a CommonHaus project.</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<h1>Initial work items/questions:</h1>\n"
"<p>Current known list, but not limited to:</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>identify design communication channels (i.e. #41973)</li>\n"
"<li>which repositories / code will move</li>\n"
"<li>impact (if any) on quarkiverse projects</li>\n"
"<li>how will trademarks work/change</li>\n"
"<li>identify running services and setup/maintain them (registry.quarkus.io, code.quarkus.io etc.)</li>\n"
"<li>add required metadata/files to the various repositories</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<h1>Tracking</h1>\n"
"<p>We will use the working group board to track publicly all the known relevant work and questions.For the few exception cases where, for legal or personal constraints, the work must happen in private, we will post the outcome and results in public places (like a GitHub discussion of a GitHub issue tracked on the working group board).</p>\n"
"<h1>When will this working group be done?</h1>\n"
"<p>When Quarkus has an active working governance model in place and all major work items around setting up Quarkus at CommonHaus are completed - after that, its expected things will just be iteratively improved, and the dedicated working group will not be needed (others might start to continue more specific efforts).</p>\n"
"<p>The majority of the work must be done before the end of December 2024. The latest deadline for CommonHaus is April 2025, when the bootstrap period of CommonHaus ends.</p>\n"
msgstr ""
"<p>来自 https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/discussions/43013 的讨论</p>\n"
"<p><a href=\"https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-in-a-foundation/\">今年年初</a>，我们开始将 Quarkus 迁移到基金会，并在最近<a href=\"https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-moving-to-commonhaus/\">确定了</a> <a href=\"https://www.commonhaus.org/\">CommonHaus</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/commonhaus/foundation/pull/183\">的</a> <a href=\"https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-moving-to-commonhaus/\">方向</a>，在暑假期间，CommonHaus 理事会<a href=\"https://github.com/commonhaus/foundation/pull/183\">批准了我们的</a>加入<a href=\"https://github.com/commonhaus/foundation/pull/183\">请求</a>。</p>\n"
"<p>因此，现在真正的工作开始了，我们成立一个工作小组，为 Quarkus 加入 CommonHaus 基金会而努力。</p>\n"
"<h1>目标</h1>\n"
"<p>两个部分</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>建立夸克软件透明、开放的管理机制</li>\n"
"<li>了解 CommonHaus 项目的一些重要要求。</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<h1>初步工作项目/问题：</h1>\n"
"<p>目前已知的清单，但不限于此：</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>确定设计交流渠道（即 #41973）</li>\n"
"<li>哪些资源库/代码将移动</li>\n"
"<li>对夸克宇宙项目的影响（如果有的话</li>\n"
"<li>商标将如何工作/更改</li>\n"
"<li>确定运行中的服务并设置/维护它们（registry.quarkus.io、code.quarkus.io 等）</li>\n"
"<li>向各种资源库添加所需的元数据/文件</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<h1>跟踪</h1>\n"
"<p>我们将使用工作组板块公开跟踪所有已知的相关工作和问题。对于少数例外情况，即由于法律或个人限制，工作必须私下进行，我们将在公共场所发布结果和成果（如在工作组板块上跟踪的 GitHub 问题的 GitHub 讨论）。</p>\n"
"<h1>工作组何时完成工作？</h1>\n"
"<p>当 Quarkus 有了一个积极的工作管理模式，并且在 CommonHaus 建立 Quarkus 的所有主要工作项目都已完成时--在那之后，预计事情将只是迭代改进，而不需要专门的工作组（其他人可能会开始继续更具体的工作）。</p>\n"
"<p>大部分工作必须在 2024 年 12 月底之前完成。CommonHaus的最晚期限为2025年4月，届时CommonHaus的引导期将结束。</p>\n"

"<h3>Problem Statement</h3>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>Spring developers rely heavily on testing constructs like @SpringBootTest, MockMvc, TestRestTemplate, and slice-based testing.</li>\n"
"<li>Quarkus, while offering its own solid testing ecosystem (e.g., @QuarkusTest, RestAssured, and Continuous Testing), doesn’t align with Spring-style testing by default.</li>\n"
"<li>This mismatch forces developers to rewrite or adapt tests when switching to Quarkus.</li>\n"
"<li>Reducing this friction aligns with Quarkus’s goal of enabling Spring developers to migrate without starting from scratch.</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<h3>Proposed Solution</h3>\n"
"<ol>\n"
"<li>Survey and identify the Spring testing APIs and techniques most widely used, across unit, controller (HTTP), and integration tests.</li>\n"
"<li>Map these to their closest equivalents in Quarkus testing infrastructure (e.g., @QuarkusTest, @QuarkusIntegrationTest, RestAssured).</li>\n"
"<li>Prototype mechanisms that allow Spring-style tests to run with minimal or no modifications in Quarkus (e.g., helper annotations, compatibility layer, quarkiverse library, tooling adaptation).</li>\n"
"<li>Define a realistic scope—supporting the most used constructs only (not all of Spring’s testing API).</li>\n"
"</ol>\n"
"<h3>Definition of Done</h3>\n"
"<p>The WG will be considered complete when the following are delivered:</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>A prioritized list of Spring testing patterns (usage-informed).</li>\n"
"<li>A mapping document detailing how each pattern corresponds to Quarkus approaches.</li>\n"
"<li>A working prototype or POC illustrating compatibility (e.g., a mini-project demonstrating Spring tests running in Quarkus).</li>\n"
"<li>PRs to Quarkus implementing support or helper utilities.</li>\n"
"<li>A migration-style guide/documentation (“How to run your Spring tests in Quarkus”).</li>\n"
"<li>A community-facing artifact (e.g., blog post, talk, or demo).</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<h3>Scope</h3>\n"
"<h3>In Scope</h3>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>Inventory &amp; prioritization of widely-used Spring testing APIs (unit, HTTP controller, integration).</li>\n"
"<li>Feasibility analysis and prototyping for compatibility.</li>\n"
"<li>Documentation drafting and an example project.</li>\n"
"<li>Coordination and communication (issues, discussion threads, milestones).</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p>⠀</p>\n"
"<h3>Out of Scope</h3>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>Full support for the entire Spring testing API surface; treating edge cases is not critical.</li>\n"
"<li>Deep re-architecting of Quarkus’s testing engine.</li>\n"
"<li>UI-level or highly niche Spring testing scenarios.</li>\n"

"<h1>Objective</h1>\n"
"<p>The main objective of this working group is to bring forth the next version of Panache.</p>\n"
"<h1>The Problem</h1>\n"
"<p>Panache is great for many things, but over time, we realised the following limitations:</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>We have three distinct versions: Hibernate ORM, Hibernate Reactive and Mongo (blocking and reactive)</li>\n"
"<li>It is impossible to use the same entities with Hibernate ORM and Hibernate Reactive</li>\n"
"<li>Stateless sessions are not supported</li>\n"
"<li>Hibernate Processor annotations, and Jakarta Data are not supported</li>\n"
"<li>We have triplicate types such as <code>Sort</code> and <code>Order</code> between Panache, ORM and Jakarta Data</li>\n"
"<li>We have two ways to place entity query operations : on the entity itself, or in repositories</li>\n"
"<li>Entity query operations require type-system hacks which makes them less type-safe than we want with <code>var</code> and <code>for-each</code> and especially with reactive operations.</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<h1>The proposed Solution</h1>\n"
"<p>We propose a new Panache version that will solve all these issues:</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>Unify all variants in a single module, supporting blocking, reactive, stateless and stateful sessions</li>\n"
"<li>Provide an entity toplevel class for each 4 modes of operation, yet allow access to the other modes</li>\n"
"<li>Move all entity query operations from the entity class to the repository class</li>\n"
"<li>Provide a repository toplevel class for each 4 modes of operation, yet allow access to the other modes</li>\n"
"<li>Provide easy access to any type of repository by placing them as nested interfaces in the entity class, via a generated accessor on the entity metamodel class</li>\n"
"<li>Provide out of the box accessors for the 4 modes of operation repositories on the entity metamodel class</li>\n"
"<li>Support Jakarta Data and Hibernate Processor type-safe annotations</li>\n"
"<li>Optional: Support of Mongo via the coming ORM JDBC support</li>\n"
"<li>Optional: provide JD repository type alternatives for the missing three modes</li>\n"
"<li>Optional: provide a way to convert Panache 1 to Panache.Next</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<h1>Definition of Done</h1>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>Deliver the new Panache extension as a <code>stable</code> state (after preview/experimental versions for feedback)</li>\n"
"<li>Tests</li>\n"
"<li>Documentation</li>\n"
"<li>Codestart</li>\n"
"<li>REST Data with Panache support</li>\n"
"<li>Renarde support</li>\n"
"<li>Quarkus Insights</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<h1>Scope of Work</h1>\n"
"<p>It is currently out of scope to retrofit this with the existing Panache modules. This will be a new module with no backward compatibility (although most type-unsafe operations will continue as-is, so you will be familiar with them).</p>\n"
"<h1>Organizing the Work</h1>\n"
"<h2>Communication and Transparency:</h2>\n"
"<p>This will be done via GitHub issues on the Quarkus core project.</p>\n"
"<h2>Expected Timeline:</h2>\n"
"<p>Most of the R&amp;D and design work has been completed over the last two years. Now remains the task of merging, documenting, testing, and tweaking it until it's complete.</p>\n"

"<li>Maintain a GitHub project board for feature status, blockers, and timelines</li>\n"
"<li>Coordinate across teams (core, extensions, platform, tooling)</li>\n"
"<li>Surface migration considerations and flag impacts (e.g. new --add-opens needs, optimized defaults) - useful to create the migration guide and rules</li>\n"
"<li>Publish ADRs, migration guides, and summary docs</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<h2>Definition of Done</h2>\n"
"<p>This WG will be considered complete when:</p>\n"

"<p>The primary saga solution for distributed transactions is <a href=\"https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/tree/main/extensions/narayana-lra\">narayana-lra</a> extension. However, it wasn't maintained and marketed as the number one solution for distributed sagas. So we either need to update LRA to make a unified solution for Quarkus or pick a different solution that was introduced in the meantime. This WG will unify Quarkus's story in a distributed transaction solution.</p>\n"
"<h3>The proposed Solution</h3>\n"
"<p>We will investigate and compare available solutions for the saga-based implementation of the distributed tx processing. This will be documented, and the choice should be proven to be able to drive development and innovation in this area. We will ensure the solution meets the Quarkus standards (build/runtime split, dev service, dev ui).</p>\n"
"<h3>Definition of Done</h3>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>A new guide for the distributed tx (or the chosen solution if there is only one)</li>\n"
"<li>Blog post comparing available solutions or just marketing the chosen solution</li>\n"
"<li>Quarkus insights about this topic</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<h3>Scope of Work</h3>\n"
"<p>The scope of this WG is to pick a chosen saga-based implementation and make it Quarkus native (dev mode, any possible enhancements). We will choose implementation with an already available Quarkus integration. Research of new saga-based alternatives is out of scope.</p>\n"
"<h3>Organizing the Work</h3>\n"
"<p>Communication and Transparency:</p>\n"
"<p>Coordination will be done in this GitHub discussion and the individual GitHub issues. GitHub issues can be closed if the saga-solution is not to be updated anymore. The decision of the chosen solution will be stated also as the resolution of https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/34181.</p>\n"
"<p>This work can take place in either Quarkus core (narayana-lra) or some new extension that will be provided in Quarkiverse.</p>\n"
"<h3>Expected Timeline:</h3>\n"
"<p>Milestone 1 - Document in this discussion saga-based implementations alternatives\n"
"Milestone 2 - Pick one solution that will be Quarkus Saga solution\n"
"Milestone 3 - Update the chosen alternative for Quarkus standards (simplification of use, dev * features)\n"
"Milestone 4 - Create a guide to document it\n"
"Milestone 5 - Blog + Quarkus insights</p>\n"

#~ "<p>At the moment, Quarkus tests are invoked using one classloader, and then executed in a different classloader. This mostly works well, but means some use cases don't work: extensions cannot manipulate test classes in the same way that they do normal application classes. For example, anything run via a JUnit @TestTemplate test case will see the un-transformed class.</p>\n"
#~ "<p>It also means we have extra user-facing complexity, such as the QuarkusTest*Callbacks](https://quarkus.io/guides/getting-started-testing#enrichment-via-quarkustestcallback):</p>\n"
#~ "<blockquote>\n"
#~ "<p>While it is possible to use JUnit Jupiter callback interfaces like BeforeEachCallback, you might run into classloading issues because Quarkus has to run tests in a custom classloader which JUnit is not aware of.</p>\n"
#~ "</blockquote>\n"
#~ "<p>A final benefit is a reduction in the internal complexity of our code. Hopping between classloaders during test execution takes a lot of work, and adds a lot of code! It also is brittle in places. For example, because the hop between classloaders relies on serialization in some cases, it's becoming harder to do as the JVM tightens up security restrictions. We used to rely on xstream, but that stopped working in Java 17. In https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/40601, @dmlloyd moved us to use the JBoss Serializer, which works better, but might still be affected by future restrictions on class access.</p>\n"
#~ "<p>The goal of this working group is to allow test classes to fully participate in the 'quarkification' of classes. The mechanism for this is probably just to load the test classes with the classloader we intend to run them with, so that JUnit sees the 'correct' version of the class.</p>\n"
#~ msgstr ""
#~ "<p>目前，Quarkus 测试使用一个类加载器调用，然后在另一个类加载器中执行。这在大多数情况下运行良好，但也意味着某些用例无法运行：扩展无法像操作普通应用程序类那样操作测试类。例如，通过 JUnit @TestTemplate 测试用例运行的任何程序都将看到未转换的类。</p>\n"
#~ "<p>这也意味着我们有额外的面向用户的复杂性，例如 QuarkusTest*Callbacks](https://quarkus.io/guides/getting-started-testing#enrichment-via-quarkustestcallback) ：</p>\n"
#~ "<blockquote>\n"
#~ "<p>虽然可以使用 JUnit Jupiter 回调接口（如 BeforeEachCallback），但可能会遇到类加载问题，因为 Quarkus 必须在 JUnit 不知道的自定义类加载器中运行测试。</p>\n"
#~ "</blockquote>\n"
#~ "<p>最后一个好处是降低了代码的内部复杂性。在测试执行过程中，在类加载器之间跳来跳去会耗费大量工作，并增加大量代码！而且在某些地方还很脆弱。例如，由于类加载器之间的跳转在某些情况下依赖于序列化，随着 JVM 收紧安全限制，这种跳转变得越来越难。我们曾经依赖 xstream，但在 Java 17 中停止使用。在 https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/40601 中，@dmlloyd 让我们使用 JBoss Serializer，它的效果更好，但仍可能受到未来类访问限制的影响。</p>\n"
#~ "<p>该工作组的目标是允许测试类完全参与类的 \"夸克化\"。其机制可能只是用我们打算运行的类加载器加载测试类，这样 JUnit 就能看到类的 \"正确 \"版本。</p>\n"
