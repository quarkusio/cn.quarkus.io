The Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol is an open standard initially developed by Google and is now part of the Linux Foundation. It enables AI agents to communicate and collaborate with one another, regardless of each agent's underlying framework, language, or vendor. This is very important, as it's paving the way for polyglot multi-agent systems. The A2A protocol has been gaining a lot of traction since being announced just a few months ago."
