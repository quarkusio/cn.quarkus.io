"Based in Helsinki, Finland, The Asiakastieto Group is a leading provider of innovative, digital business and consumer information services in the Nordic region. In the banking, financial services, and retail industries, Asiakastieto’s products and services support risk management, finance and business administration, credit or loan-related  decision-making, sales and marketing.\n"
"When the EU introduced its revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) in 2018 to increase competition, promote innovation, and improve security in the payments industry, Asiakastieto began evaluating how to help its customers manage the impact of the directive. This initiative aligned with one of the company’s key corporate social responsibility goals: to increase trust in society. The Asiakastieto Group has many brands such as UC AB, Intellia Oy, and Suomen Asiakastieto Oy, the latter being the one that we cover in this user story."

msgid "Suomen Asiakastieto Oy has many different departments: Risk Decision, SME & Consumer, Customer Data Management, Digital Processes. Real Estate and Collateral Information, which operates within Digital Processes, had deployed to their application server instance a new application, which happened to have issues while running in production affecting the stability of the application server and hence other applications running on it. This resulted in the need to reboot the application server every time this anomaly occurred leading to unexpected downtime and to a negative customer satisfaction."
msgstr "Suomen Asiakastieto Oy有许多不同的部门。风险决策部、中小企业与消费者部、客户数据管理部、数字流程部。在数字流程中运作的房地产和抵押品信息部在他们的应用服务器实例中部署了一个新的应用程序，该应用程序在生产中运行时碰巧出现了问题，影响了应用服务器的稳定性，从而影响了在其上运行的其他应用程序。这导致每次发生这种异常情况时都需要重新启动应用服务器，导致意外的停机时间和负面的客户满意度。"

msgid "Because of this, they decided to adopt microservice architectures to introduce better resilience and high-availability into their solutions so that if a microservice or an application went awry, it would not affect the entire system. So, when the time came to start developing their PSD2 project, they decided to start implementing microservices in Thorntail, which is an open source application assembler - similar to Spring Boot - that also implements MicroProfile, an community-driven open source specification for Java microservices. They decided on Thorntail because its functionality and capabilities were close to the application server capabilities they were familiar with. After being in production for a few months, they learned about Quarkus and its innovative approach that rethinks Java for containers, cloud and Kubernetes. Around the same time, they also learned about the end-of-life of Thorntail. Their continued desire to develop new microservices as well as to break their monolithic application servers into microservices made them evaluate Quarkus more in depth."
msgstr "正因为如此，他们决定采用微服务架构，在其解决方案中引入更好的弹性和高可用性，这样，如果一个微服务或一个应用程序出现问题，就不会影响整个系统。因此，当开始开发他们的PSD2项目时，他们决定开始在Thorntail中实现微服务，这是一个开源的应用程序组装器--类似于Spring Boot--也实现了MicroProfile，一个社区驱动的Java微服务开源规范。他们决定采用Thorntail，因为它的功能和能力与他们所熟悉的应用服务器能力相近。在生产了几个月后，他们了解到Quarkus和它的创新方法，为容器、云和Kubernetes重新思考了Java。大约在同一时间，他们也了解到Thorntail的寿命结束了。他们继续渴望开发新的微服务，并将他们的单体应用服务器打破为微服务，这使他们更深入地评估Quarkus。"

msgid "With respect to their monoliths, they have about twelve JBoss EAP instances, each running dozens of their applications. As a first step to make the entire system more distributed, they decided to start moving some of these workloads to OpenShift by running many instances of JBoss EAP, each containing a single application. As a result, they experienced high memory consumption. At this point, they started looking into ways to reduce the footprint of these applications running on OpenShift."
msgstr "关于他们的单体，他们有大约12个JBoss EAP实例，每个实例都运行着他们的几十个应用。作为使整个系统更加分布式的第一步，他们决定开始将其中一些工作负载转移到OpenShift，运行许多JBoss EAP的实例，每个实例包含一个应用程序。结果，他们遇到了高内存消耗。在这一点上，他们开始研究如何减少这些在OpenShift上运行的应用程序的足迹。"

msgid "With respect to their existing Thorntail microservices, which they needed to migrate to Quarkus, they noticed that spinning up a Thorntail container was taking about 1 minute to start up. When they migrated it to Quarkus, the service now starts in 0.4 seconds! With this improved startup time, they could scale up their services faster so that they could be readily available faster to process extra traffic leading to a better customer experience during peak times since customers would not have to wait on the browser to have their requests serviced, for example."
msgstr "关于他们现有的Thorntail微服务，他们需要将其迁移到Quarkus，他们注意到，启动一个Thorntail容器需要1分钟左右。当他们把它迁移到Quarkus时，服务现在只需要0.4秒就可以启动了。有了这个改进的启动时间，他们可以更快地扩展他们的服务，这样他们就可以更快地随时处理额外的流量，从而在高峰期带来更好的客户体验，因为客户不必在浏览器上等待他们的请求得到服务，例如。"

msgid "According to Eero, _“migrating from Thorntail to JVM-Quarkus was trivial and memory consumption went down by about 75% while CPU consumption was reduced by about 70%. This was accompanied by a 40% increase in throughput resulting in a faster response time. Migrating to Quarkus native, we found that the application ran at a better throughput even with 50MB of memory which is 95% less than with Thorntail. We also identified a space-time tradeoff between different native Quarkus setups: deploying it with 200MB of memory instead of 50MB will reduce its CPU requirements by two thirds. Thus, if we ever had to balance CPU vs memory within our OpenShift cluster, this would prove useful.”_"
msgstr "根据Eero的说法， _\"从Thorntail迁移到JVM-Quarkus是微不足道的，内存消耗减少了约75%，CPU消耗减少了约70%。同时，吞吐量也增加了40%，从而加快了响应时间。迁移到Quarkus本机后，我们发现，即使是50MB的内存，应用程序也能以更好的吞吐量运行，比Thorntail少了95%。我们还发现了不同的Quarkus原生设置之间的时空权衡：用200MB的内存而不是50MB的内存来部署它，将减少三分之二的CPU需求。因此，如果我们不得不在我们的OpenShift集群内平衡CPU与内存，这将证明是有用的\"。_ "

"They use and like the Quarkus development mode, also known as live coding, a lot. Before Quarkus, they used to use JRebel, for hot replacing but it was unreliable. According to Eero _“Quarkus development mode has by far a better track record.”_  Now that they are writing new microservices, they have made it a best practice to use live coding. With Thorntail, there were manual steps to deploy changes to try them out whereas with Quarkus, the changes are automatically applied to the running process so that the developer can immediately test the application. This makes developers more productive in that they can verify and troubleshoot their code faster.\n"
"Eero took it upon himself to deliver a small internal Quarkus workshop, which got developers very excited about this new and innovative technology, _“people are looking forward to working with Quarkus”_, mentioned Eero. Quarkus is getting developers excited and this has led to other developers across the organization to use Quarkus for their projects."

msgid "As awesome as Quarkus is, this constantly evolving and innovative technology had some areas for improvement. For example, Eero mentioned that Java API for XML Web Services (JAX-WS) didn’t work on native mode. Also SSL, by default, is disabled but available for HTTP/S, which he needed to use and got it to work following the configuration instructions, which he found complex. In addition, he would like to see improvements in how reflection is currently configured, which was time-consuming to configure because he had to use a trial-and-error approach to get it to work. He’d like to see a way to make this reflection configuration process easier to carry out."
msgstr "尽管Quarkus很了不起，但这项不断发展的创新技术也有一些需要改进的地方。例如，Eero提到Java API for XML Web Services (JAX-WS)不能在本地模式下工作。另外，SSL在默认情况下是禁用的，但对HTTP/S是可用的，他需要使用SSL，并按照配置说明让它工作，他认为这很复杂。此外，他希望看到改进目前反射的配置方式，配置起来很费时，因为他不得不使用试错的方法来使其工作。他希望看到一种方法，使这种反射配置过程更容易进行。"

msgid "Because Quarkus takes the approach of a closed world for application development, there needs to be a bit of a mind shift when writing applications. As an example, for their existing applications, Asiakastieto used a configuration manager to read in configuration information (connection URLs, DB connections strings, etc.) at application startup. Since with Quarkus, in native mode, part of the application startup happens during build time, they had to reconfigure the configuration manager to read in the configuration information when the application was run. Although the change was easy to make, it highlights the importance of understanding how Quarkus applications need to be implemented under this new paradigm."
msgstr "因为Quarkus采取的是封闭式的应用开发方式，所以在编写应用时需要有一定的思想转变。举个例子，对于他们现有的应用程序，Asiakastieto使用配置管理器在应用程序启动时读入配置信息（连接URL、数据库连接字符串等）。由于Quarkus在本地模式下，部分应用程序的启动发生在构建时间，他们不得不重新配置配置管理器，以便在应用程序运行时读入配置信息。虽然这个改变很容易做到，但它强调了理解Quarkus应用程序在这种新模式下需要如何实现的重要性。"
