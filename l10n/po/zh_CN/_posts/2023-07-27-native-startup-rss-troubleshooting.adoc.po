"During the development of Quarkus 2.13,\n"
"we discovered that there was a startup degradation in native mode.\n"
"One of the key aspects of this degradation was that RSS consumption on start up had gone up by about 10-15% compared to Quarkus 2.7.\n"
"In this blog post you will learn how the Quarkus native RSS consumption debugging techniques described in\n"
"https://quarkus.io/guides/native-reference#rss[the Quarkus native reference guide]\n"
"were used to diagnose this issue.\n"
"You will also learn about recent updates in GraalVM that make doing this kind of analysis more convenient."

"Our analysis showed that the RSS consumption for Quarkus 2.7 was about ~33MB while for Quarkus 2.13 it was about ~36MB, roughly a 10 % increase.\n"

"Since Quarkus 2.7 and 2.13 used different GraalVM versions (21.3 vs 22.3),\n"
"we first investigated whether the increase in the startup time and RSS consumption was due to a change in GraalVM.\n"
"This turned out to not be the case,\n"
"as using the same GraalVM version on both Quarkus versions still resulted in similar differences."

"We also profiled the startup time in JVM mode,\n"
"and although we could observe some slight increase in heap usage,\n"
"the RSS increase was not apparent at runtime.\n"
"So, the challenge was to understand what was causing the RSS increase that seemed to only affect native mode\n"
"and that was Quarkus specific."

"In native mode we needed to look for system calls that increased RSS,\n"
"and investigate what caused them.\n"
"There are several system calls that can be used to allocate memory, e.g. `malloc`, `mmap`...etc,\n"
"but when we analysed the system calls emitted on startup,\n"
"we discovered that `mmap` calls were the prominent ones.\n"
"Following\n"
"https://www.brendangregg.com/FlameGraphs/memoryflamegraphs.html[Brendan Greggâ€™s Memory Leak (and Growth) Flame Graphs guide]\n"
"on a Linux environment,\n"
"we were able to produce flamegraphs for the `mmap` system calls.\n"
"To obtain these flamegraphs, we capture the `sys_enter_mmap` system call events with `perf record`,\n"
"and then we generate flamegraphs with the recorded data:"

"`mmap` calls happen for a variety of reasons,\n"
"but in the context of this blog post,\n"
"we're interested in those `mmap` calls that are triggered by object allocations.\n"
"Not every object allocation triggers an `mmap` call.\n"
"Instead, each thread in SubstrateVM will allocate a heap chunk using `mmap` when the first object is allocated,\n"
"and it will use this heap chunk as long as there's space for further objects allocated in the same thread.\n"
"When the heap chunk is full,\n"
"the thread will request a new heap chunk using `mmap`.\n"
"This pattern is called thread-local allocation.\n"
"HotSpot has a similar feature as well,\n"
"but there the heap chunk size is dynamically computed depending on multiple factors,\n"
"while on SubstrateVM the size is fixed.\n"
"At the time of writing, the default heap chunk size is 1MB,\n"
"but an upcoming change will make it 512KB instead."

"We describe the object allocation as fast when the thread has a heap chunk cached and there's enough space for the object.\n"
"We describe the object allocation as slow when the thread needs to request a new heap chunk via the `mmap` system call to satisfy the object allocation.\n"
"Slow allocations are the most interesting in this case,\n"
"because they give us a rough indication of which allocations are pushing the number of heap chunks up,\n"
"and therefore are pushing the RSS consumption up.\n"
"In SubstrateVM, stacktraces of the slow allocation path contain invocations to methods defined in the `com.oracle.svm.core.genscavenge.ThreadLocalAllocation` class that contain the `slowPathNew` prefix in their name .\n"
"E.g. `slowPathNewInstance` for plain objects or `slowPathNewArray` for arrays."

"The areas of interest in the flamegraphs are those stacktraces that contain `ApplicationImpl.doStart()` method call,\n"
"because that's the method that is responsible for starting up Quarkus applications.\n"
"We want to find out how many slow path allocations are visible in these stacktraces,\n"
"which are executed by the `main` thread.\n"
"Also, by looking at the stacktraces that cause these slow path allocations,\n"
"we can get an idea of which components might be allocation heavy.\n"
"If you focus the flamegraph on that method,\n"
"and then click on `Search` at the top right and type `slowPathNew`,\n"
"you can observe which of the `sys_enter_mmap` system calls are related to native heap memory allocation."
