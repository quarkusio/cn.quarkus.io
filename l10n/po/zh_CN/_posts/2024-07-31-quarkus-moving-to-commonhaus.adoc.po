msgid "Today, we are thrilled to announce that the Quarkus project is transitioning to the Commonhaus Foundation. Quarkus grew as a research effort inside Red Hat with the goal to revolutionise Java for the Cloud Era and since 2019 when it was unveiled as a community project, Quarkus has been nurtured and supported by Red Hat. This move to Commonhaus aligns with our https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-in-a-foundation/[vision of fostering a more inclusive and collaborative environment]."

msgid "Quarkus has seen tremendous growth and adoption, especially with the recent advancements in Java and Kubernetes-native development. Despite our successes, our vibrant and ever-expanding Quarkus community with over 900 contributors, there is still the perception that Quarkus is too dependent on Red Hat. We aim to change this by providing a neutral ground where other organisations and contributors can feel equally valued and involved."
