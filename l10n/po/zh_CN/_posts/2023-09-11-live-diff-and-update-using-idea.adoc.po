"With the editor, you can effortlessly create and update the necessary resources for application deployment. The dynamic resource tree provides real-time visibility of these resources as they are created. By utilizing the diff feature in the editor, you can observe how the cluster manipulates your resources during creation, allowing you to identify important details such as the generated hostname. Lastly, we have showcased additional features of the plugin, including the ability to monitor application logs and access a terminal shell within the running container."
