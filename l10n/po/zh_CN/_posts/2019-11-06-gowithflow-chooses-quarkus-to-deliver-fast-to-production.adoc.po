msgid "GoWithFlow, a recent startup based out of Portugal, a spin-off from https://www.ceiia.com/[CEiiA] with https://www.galp.com/corp/en/[Galp] as a majority shareholder, provides integrated mobility solutions that can both provision end-to-end services to new mobility operators (eg. running a scooter-sharing network, managing an EV charging network, managing a fleet), but also gather data from other mobility operators, e.g.car-sharing operators, public transportation, etc, and thus provide a single access to mobility within a city. They consolidate all this data for consumption by citizens via their mobile phone apps that can help them locate the closest shared vehicle, or the most optimal way to get from point A to point B using multiple transportation options, for example."

In addition, it was taking them 2 to 3 months to go to production every time there was a change, no matter how small it was, which required them to deploy the entire system - even parts that had not been modified at all - making the whole process highly risky."

Nevertheless, they did spend some time familiarizing themselves with aspects related to native images and features for which Quarkus did not yet have extensions."

msgid "Once GoWithFlow selected Quarkus for Java development, they started a prototype project, which consisted of the implementation of 4 microservices. Using the Quarkus built-in testing harness, developers implemented automated tests, which are run during build time in both JVM and native modes. They also optimized the pipeline processes to avoid any human intervention during the deployment to production, where the microservices run in native mode. Integration testing consists of launching the application and testing the entire system through the web interface, which invokes the Quarkus microservices. All this work was accomplished by 3 developers from their Architecture team and GoWithFlow is very happy with what they have accomplished so far."
msgstr "当GoWithFlow选择Quarkus进行Java开发时，他们开始了一个原型项目，其中包括4个微服务的实现。使用Quarkus内置的测试线束，开发人员实现了自动化测试，这些测试在JVM和本地模式下的构建时间内运行。他们还优化了管道流程，以避免在部署到生产过程中的任何人工干预，其中微服务以本地模式运行。集成测试包括启动应用程序，并通过调用Quarkus微服务的Web界面来测试整个系统。所有这些工作都是由他们的架构团队的3名开发人员完成的，GoWithFlow对他们目前所完成的工作非常满意。"

msgid "GoWithFlow had been running their application in a monolithic application server. This meant that they had to roll out the entire application to production even if a small change had been applied to it. Besides being time consuming with releases taking 2 to 3 months, they felt that this was risky because they had to constantly release code that hadn’t been modified. In addition, developers had to wait 2 to 3 minutes to see their changes while they waited for the deployment of their changes to the application server. These lengthened the development process, which negatively impacted developer productivity and their ability to innovate and stay ahead of the competition. They worked on speeding up their development process and a key element that helped them accomplish this was the container-first approach of Quarkus. Now, they no longer have to wait months for production releases. In addition, developers can now use Quarkus live coding capabilities to test their source code changes immediately, which saves a lot of development and troubleshooting time, as described by Raul _“live coding is one of Quarkus best features if not the best one.”_"
msgstr "GoWithFlow一直在单体应用服务器中运行他们的应用程序。这意味着他们必须将整个应用推广到生产中，即使是一个小的变化。除了耗费时间，发布需要2到3个月的时间，他们认为这是有风险的，因为他们必须不断地发布没有被修改的代码。此外，开发人员不得不等待2到3分钟才能看到他们的修改，同时他们还要等待将他们的修改部署到应用服务器上。这些都延长了开发过程，这对开发人员的生产力以及他们的创新和保持竞争优势的能力产生了负面影响。他们努力加快他们的开发过程，帮助他们实现这一目标的一个关键因素是Quarkus的容器优先方法。现在，他们不再需要等待几个月的生产发布。此外，开发人员现在可以使用Quarkus的实时编码功能，立即测试他们的源代码变化，这节省了大量的开发和故障排除时间，正如Raul所描述的那样 _，\"实时编码是Quarkus最好的功能之一，如果不是最好的话。_ "
