"Windows is essentially the same but requires a little more attention and knowledge about the tooling. Getting it working required some investigation on how the native build depends on Visual Studio. Also,the Windows runners on GitHub Actions have a too small page-file by default. That needs increasing as the memory consumption is rather high when running the GraalVMs `native-image` command.\n"
