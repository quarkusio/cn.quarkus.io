msgid "Last week, David, a Quarkus user, asked me about retrying an asynchronous operation.  David has a _picky_ remote HTTP service, which sometimes misbehaves.  Easy answer! Just do: `uni.onFailure().retry().atMost(x)`.  But, David is curious, and asked me a second question: how does retry work? Well, that’s simple; it just retries...  As you can imagine, that did not satisfy David’s curiosity."

msgid "Okay, if you are the kind of reader who skips the terms and conditions, you can jump to the next section.  But, for others, I need to warn you about retries.  Retries may not be the solution to your problem, as it can be terrible.  Retrying can only be done if your system can handle duplicated requests or messages.  In other words, you can only retry if your system is idempotent, i.e., sending a request or a message multiple times does not change the overall state.  In doubt, check before implementing a retry, as it can harm your system."
