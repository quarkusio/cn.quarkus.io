msgid "**TL;DR:** As of `1.11.5.Final` and `1.12.1.Final`, leading slashes matter in config. So if you use `/endpoint`, that endpoint will be served from the absolute root. If you want it relative to some containing bucket, omit that leading slash. For example, `quarkus.http.non-application-root-path` is now `q` by default, which nests it under `quarkus.http.root-path`, matching the original behavior. You can use an absolute path, e.g. `/q`, to serve non-application endpoints from the absolute root (as a sibling of the http root, if that is set). To remove the non-application endpoint behavior entirely, set `quarkus.http.non-application-root-path` to the same value as `quarkus.http.root-path`. The most foolproof way to do this is using a variable: `quarkus.http.non-application-root-path=${quarkus.http.root-path}`.\n"
