"The internals of Quarkus test classloading have been rewritten in 3.22.\n"
"It does not affect production and dev modes, or some Quarkus test modes, such as `@QuarkusIntegrationTest`, `@QuarkusComponentTest`.\n"
"However, `@QuarkusTest` has changed.\n"
"This change should make Quarkus testing work better, and it allowed us to fix a pile of longstanding bugs.\n"
"It will also allow us to improve the integration with test frameworks such as Pact.\n"
"However, it did introduce a few bugs we know about, and most likely also some bugs we don't yet know about.\n"
"We're keen to get feedback from the community so that we can get fixing."

"This mostly worked very well, and meant that `QuarkusTest` tests mostly behaved as if they were part of the same application as the code under test.\n"
"The Quarkus test framework could start and stop Quarkus instances at the right point in the test lifecycle, inject CDI dependencies, and do other useful Quarkus bytecode manipulation.\n"
"However, some use cases didn't work. Tests using advanced JUnit 5 features like `@TestTemplate` and `@ParameterizedTest` sometimes found that the same test code might appear to run in several classloaders in a single test, or that injected dependencies weren't always available."

"Over time, test-related defects were building up that couldn't be changed without a fundamental rewrite of how Quarkus loads and executes tests.\n"
"The Quarkus test code itself was also growing ever-more complex as it tried to work around various JUnit edge cases. Moving test instances from one classloader to another involved serializing and deserialization, which is harder to implement on newer JVM versions with tighter class security. For example, Quarkus used to use XStream as the serialization provider, but XStream no longer works with Java 17 and higher, because of reflection restrictions in the newer JVMs."

With the new testing design, all augmentation happens at the beginning of the test run, during the JUnit discovery phase. This means all Dev Services also start at the beginning of the test run. If several test classes with different Dev Service configuration are augmented before any tests are run, multiple differently-configured Dev Services may be running at the same time. This can cause port conflicts and cross-talk on configuration values. We're hoping to have a https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/45785[fix] for this in the next release. As a workaround, splitting conflicting tests into separate projects should fix symptoms."

Of course, we all know tests should not depend on execution order if they don't set an order explicitly.

We discovered some tests in our own suite that were sensitive to the execution order, and other people may make similar discoveries."

Because classloading is frontloaded at the beginning of the test run, rather than between test executions, there's less time for asynchronous operations to finish between tests. For example, there may no longer be time for external state to 'reset' before the next test starts. This might expose some heisenbugs in test suites."
