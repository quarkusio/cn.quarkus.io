"Suppose you have your application, and your code base contains tests.\n"
"You can configure Surefire (or the plugin you use to execute your tests) to dump a stack trace as soon as a virtual thread is going to pin the carrier thread (instead of being unmounted smoothly).\n"

"Dumping the stack trace may not be very convenient when your logs are already long.\n"
"Fortunately, we released a small Junit 5 extension that allows you to fail the tests when pinning is detected.\n"
