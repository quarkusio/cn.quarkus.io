msgid "Kubernetes Operators are quickly emerging as a new class of Cloud Native applications.  These applications essentially watch the Kubernetes API and react to changes on various resources and can be used to manage the lifecycle of all kinds of complex systems like databases, messaging systems and much much more.  On the implementation side, Operators benefit from having a very low footprint as there can be potentially a very large number of them running in a cluster."

This new extension allows developers to code in their environment of choice using the well established Fabric8 Kubernetes Client while also being able to create a low footprint native binary."
