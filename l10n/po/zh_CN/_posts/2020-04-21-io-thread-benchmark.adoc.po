msgid "A competitor recently published a microbenchmark comparing the performance of their stack to Quarkus.  The Quarkus team feels this microbenchmark shouldn’t be taken at face value because it wasn’t making a like-to-like comparison leading to incorrect conclusions.  Both of the two frameworks under comparison support reactive processing.  Reactive processing enables running the business logic directly on the _IO thread_, which ultimately performs better in microbenchmark focusing on response time and concurrency.  The microbenchmark should have been written so that both frameworks (or neither framework) obtain this benefit.  Anyway, this turns out to be a very interesting topic and good information for Quarkus users, so read on."

msgid "In general, Java web applications use imperative programming combined with blocking IO operations.  This is incredibly popular because it is easier to reason about the code.  _Things_ get executed sequentially.  To make sure one request is not affected by another, they are run on different threads.  When your workload needs to interact with a database or another remote service, it relies on blocking IO.  The thread is blocked waiting for the answer.  Other requests running on different threads are not slowed down significantly.  But this means one thread for every concurrent request, which limits the overall concurrency."

#. type: Plain text
#: upstream/_posts/2020-04-21-io-thread-benchmark.adoc:64
msgid "On the other side, the reactive execution model embraces asynchronous development models and non blocking IOs.  With this model, multiple requests can be handled by the same thread.  When the processing of a request cannot make progress anymore (because it requests a remote service, or interacts with a database), it uses non blocking IO.  This releases the thread immediately, which can then be used to serve another request.  When the result of the IO operation is available, the processing of the request is restored and continues its execution.  This model enables the usage of the _IO thread_ to handle multiple requests.  There are two significant benefits.  First, the response time is smaller because it does not have to jump to another thread.  Second, it reduces memory consumption as it decreases the usage of threads.  The reactive model uses the hardware resources more efficiently, but... there is a significant drawback.  If the processing of a request starts to block, this gets real bad.  No other request can be handled.  To avoid this, you need to learn how to write non blocking code, how to structure asynchronous processing, and how to use non blocking IOs.  It's a paradigm shift."

msgid "In Quarkus, we want to make the shift as easy as possible.  However, we have observed that the majority of user applications are written using the imperative model.  That is why, when the user application uses JAX-RS, Quarkus defaults to execute the (imperative) workload to a _worker thread_."
