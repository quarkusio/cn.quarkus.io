msgid "This post presented the Quarkus LangChain4j extension. This is the first version of the extension, and we continue exploring and experimenting with approaches to integrate LLMs into Quarkus applications. We are looking for feedback and ideas to improve these integrations. We are working on removing some rough angles, and exploring other ways to integrate LLMs and to bring developer joy when integrating with LLMs."

msgid "This extension would not have been possible without the fantastic work from Dmytro Liubarskyi on the LangChain4j library. Our collaboration has allowed us to provide a Quarkus-friendly approach to integrate the library (including native compilation support) and shape a new way to integrate LLMs in Quarkus applications. The current design was tailored to enable Quarkus applications to use LLM easily. You can basically hook up any of your _beans_ as tools or ingest data into a store. In addition, any of your bean can now interact with an LLM."
