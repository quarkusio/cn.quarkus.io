msgid "On January 22, 2020, we were informed that Quarkus had won the DeveloperWeek DEVIES Awards in the category of Best Innovation in: Code Frameworks/Libraries. As a Kubernetes-native Java stack, Quarkus represents a fundamental shift in modern application development that makes Java a great fit for cloud-native application architectures, such as containers, microservices and serverless. Java developers are able to use Quarkus to build applications that have a faster startup time and take up significantly less memory. Quarkus works out-of-the-box with popular Java standards, frameworks and libraries. Developers can choose the Java frameworks they want for their applications, which can be run in JVM mode or compiled and run in native mode. Quarkus includes developer productivity capabilities, like live coding that immediately applies source code changes to your running application, unified imperative and reactive programming with an embedded managed event bus, unified configuration and easy native executable generation. Quarkus builds applications to consume 1/10th the memory when compared to traditional Java, and can have 300x faster startup times, significantly reducing the cost of cloud resources."
