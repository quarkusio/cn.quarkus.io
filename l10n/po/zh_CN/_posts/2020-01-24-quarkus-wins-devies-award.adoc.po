msgid "On January 22, 2020, we were informed that Quarkus had won the DeveloperWeek DEVIES Awards in the category of Best Innovation in: Code Frameworks/Libraries. As a Kubernetes-native Java stack, Quarkus represents a fundamental shift in modern application development that makes Java a great fit for cloud-native application architectures, such as containers, microservices and serverless. Java developers are able to use Quarkus to build applications that have a faster startup time and take up significantly less memory. Quarkus works out-of-the-box with popular Java standards, frameworks and libraries. Developers can choose the Java frameworks they want for their applications, which can be run in JVM mode or compiled and run in native mode. Quarkus includes developer productivity capabilities, like live coding that immediately applies source code changes to your running application, unified imperative and reactive programming with an embedded managed event bus, unified configuration and easy native executable generation. Quarkus builds applications to consume 1/10th the memory when compared to traditional Java, and can have 300x faster startup times, significantly reducing the cost of cloud resources."
msgstr "2020年1月22日，我们被告知Quarkus赢得了DeveloperWeek DEVIES奖的最佳创新类别。代码框架/库。作为一个Kubernetes原生的Java堆栈，Quarkus代表了现代应用开发的根本转变，使Java非常适合云原生应用架构，如容器、微服务和无服务器。Java开发者能够使用Quarkus来构建启动时间更快、占用内存更少的应用程序。Quarkus与流行的Java标准、框架和库开箱即用。开发人员可以为他们的应用程序选择他们想要的Java框架，这些框架可以在JVM模式下运行，也可以在本地模式下编译和运行。Quarkus包括开发人员的生产力，如实时编码，立即将源代码的变化应用到你正在运行的应用程序，统一的命令式和反应式编程与嵌入式管理事件总线，统一的配置和简单的本地可执行文件生成。与传统的Java相比，Quarkus构建的应用程序消耗1/10的内存，并且启动时间可以快300倍，大大降低了云资源的成本。"
