msgid "What is interesting about this framework is that it is not revolutionary. Since some of Payair’s developers had mainly Spring experience, we were concerned that it would be difficult for them to “switch sides”. It turned out that our fear of the unknown was completely unfounded. Quarkus leverages some good old Jakarta EE standards that all Java developers are familiar with. We did not have to learn a bunch of new APIs that are advertised as \"the best way to create REST endpoint\" or \"reinvented database access\". Instead, Quarkus uses Context Dependency Injection for beans, JAX-RS for RESTful web services, JPA for database access and many others."

msgid "Optimizing enterprise Java for a microservice architecture is a challenging task and, in my opinion, MicroProfile handles it pretty well. As a long term Spring developer I realized that Spring is slowly becoming the very thing it swore to destroy. The initial premises of Spring (which basically can be summed up as a lightweight alternative to Jakarta EE) are way past the expiry date now. Spring is the undisputed heavyweight champion that can handle everything you imagine but is not your best option for fast and light services. And that applies to Spring Boot as well."

msgid "One of my personal concerns when switching from Spring to something based on Jakarta EE was lack of Spring Data JPA. I really like the mix of simplicity and functionality this module provides. But it turned out that Quarkus has my back on this one as well. There is an extension called Hibernate ORM with Panache. It is a layer on top of Hibernate ORM which focuses on simplifying ORM to the maximum without compromising the actual power that ORM gives. Panache has managed to find a sweet spot of making it trivial to work with simple entities without giving up possibilities for handling complicated use case scenarios. Bravo to Panache and adios to Spring Data!"
