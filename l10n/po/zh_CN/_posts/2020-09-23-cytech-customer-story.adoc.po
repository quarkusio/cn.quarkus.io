msgid "It's not new that tourism is one of the most affected industries from the Covid-19 pandemic. Hotels, restaurants, airlines, cruises are some of the businesses that had a really tough time this summer. Many countries, especially those whose economies rely on tourism, were looking for solutions to open up the borders for tourists while not imposing their citizens to a significant health risk. There are no magic solutions here, but there is always room for doing your best to satisfy both requirements."
msgstr "旅游业是受Covid-19大流行病影响最大的行业之一，这并不新鲜。酒店、餐馆、航空公司、游轮是今年夏天过得非常艰难的一些企业。许多国家，特别是那些经济依赖旅游业的国家，正在寻找解决方案，为游客开放边界，同时不把他们的公民强加于一个重大的健康风险。这里没有神奇的解决方案，但总是有空间尽最大努力满足这两个要求。"

msgid "The Greek government decided at some point to open up the borders to help the economy, but it would be too reckless to do it without precautions and measures. That's why they decided to build a system based on advanced technology that would choose the right travelers for Covid-19 testing. The idea is the following: if you cannot afford to test everyone, you should test those who are more likely to be positive to a Covid-19 test. This way, the Greek state can use its resources wisely and, at the same time, save money for tests."
msgstr "希腊政府在某种程度上决定开放边境以帮助经济，但如果没有预防措施和措施，这样做就太鲁莽了。这就是为什么他们决定建立一个基于先进技术的系统，选择合适的旅行者进行Covid-19测试。这个想法是这样的：如果你没有能力测试所有人，你应该测试那些更可能对Covid-19测试呈阳性的人。这样，希腊国家可以明智地使用其资源，同时，也可以节省测试的费用。"

msgid "The question is: how. And this is the part that we entered the scene. A team of scientists already proposed an AI and machine learning algorithm. Its ambition was to cover precisely the need described above by efficiently choosing the right people to be tested. But these algorithms need data, and at that point, detailed data from the passengers entering the country were not available in any digital and organized form."
msgstr "问题是：如何。而这正是我们进入现场的部分。一个科学家团队已经提出了一种人工智能和机器学习算法。它的野心正是要通过有效地选择合适的人接受测试来覆盖上述需求。但这些算法需要数据，而在当时，进入该国的乘客的详细数据还没有以任何数字和组织形式提供。"

msgid "The Greek government assigned our company, https://www.cytechmobile.com/[Cytech], to build a software that would gather the information from the passengers, filter it and pass it to all involved parties so they can do their job. One of them was the machine learning system called https://news.wharton.upenn.edu/press-releases/2020/07/marshall-wharton-researchers-team-with-entrepreneurs-and-policy-makers-to-help-reopen-greek-economy/[EVA]. But the list with the parties needing this information is much longer: it includes the civil protection agency, the ministry of health, border agents, airlines, etc. At the same time, it would send an email to each of the passengers to inform them that their application is under review. When EVA would come up with the result, it would send it back to us to email passengers the final document. Without it, their entrance into the country would not be permitted. To make a long story short, our job was to build a demanding https://travel.gov.gr[web form] to gather all passenger's data. Still, the most important part was to create a Data Broker capable of exchanging the right data with all the other information systems emphasizing speed, robustness, and resilience."
msgstr "希腊政府指派我们公司 link:https://www.cytechmobile.com/[骏龙公司] 建立一个软件，从乘客那里收集信息，进行过滤，并将其传递给所有相关方，以便他们能够完成他们的工作。其中之一是名为 link:https://news.wharton.upenn.edu/press-releases/2020/07/marshall-wharton-researchers-team-with-entrepreneurs-and-policy-makers-to-help-reopen-greek-economy/[EVA] 的机器学习系统。但需要这些信息的各方的名单要长得多：包括民事保护机构、卫生部、边境代理人、航空公司等。同时，它将向每个乘客发送一封电子邮件，通知他们他们的申请正在审查中。当长春亚运会有了结果，它就会把结果发回给我们，把最终文件发给乘客。如果没有这个文件，他们将不被允许进入该国。长话短说，我们的工作是建立一个苛刻的 link:https://travel.gov.gr[网络表格] 来收集所有乘客的数据。然而，最重要的部分是创建一个数据经纪人，能够与所有其他信息系统交换正确的数据，强调速度、稳健性和弹性。"

msgid "The requirements of the Broker platform for the https://travel.gov.gr[Passenger Locator Form] project's backend mainly revolved around exposing REST API endpoints for the UI to consume, as well as interconnect with government-related 3rd parties for required data exchange, such as EVA, EODY (National Public Health Organization), GGPP (the General Secretariat for Civil Protection) and the Greek COVID19 patient's registry. Also, to be delivered within the extreme deadlines we had, as well as being able to cover the large-scale needs of the project, we also required our tools to be mature and proven and provide us with developer productivity, (horizontal) scalability, and maximum efficiency/performance with the minimum possible resources."
msgstr "乘客 link:https://travel.gov.gr[定位表] 项目的后台经纪平台的要求主要是围绕暴露REST API端点供用户界面使用，以及与政府相关的第三方互联以进行必要的数据交换，如EVA、EODY（国家公共卫生组织）、GGPP（公民保护总秘书处）和希腊COVID19病人登记处。此外，为了在极短的期限内交付，以及能够满足项目的大规模需求，我们还要求我们的工具是成熟的、经过验证的，并为我们提供开发人员的生产力、（横向）可扩展性，以及用尽可能少的资源实现最大的效率/性能。"

msgid "We had a positive experience with Quarkus in the past with small scale projects, but we were already impressed with its features for ease of use and increased productivity. Since Quarkus is based on industry standards (Microprofile and Jakarta EE APIs), it was straightforward for our developers to get up to speed very quickly and within the very tight deadlines. Also, the Guides section on Quarkus’s website helped to get immediate feedback on the few parts that did not auto-magically work as expected."
msgstr "在过去的小规模项目中，我们对Quarkus有着积极的体验，但它的易用性和提高生产力的特点已经给我们留下了深刻印象。由于Quarkus是基于工业标准（Microprofile和Jakarta EE APIs），我们的开发人员可以在非常紧迫的期限内迅速上手，非常简单。另外，Quarkus网站上的指南部分也帮助我们在少数不能自动按预期工作的部分得到了及时的反馈。"

msgid "An application with such a critical impact is required to be robust. There was simply no room for outages of any kind, which would mean people being rejected entering our country, or even being deported at the borders! Testing is a first-class citizen in the Quarkus development lifecycle, and that enabled us to increase robustness and confidence in the application in minimal time. Testing the application under production circumstances was as easy as annotating the test class with @QuarkusTest and handling the database using @QuarkusTestResource and TestContainers. We were able to achieve very high code coverage and (most importantly) not only on the easy paths but deep down to every part of the application. This played a huge role in the application’s 100% uptime and availability, from the moment it was first deployed and exposed to the public."
msgstr "一个具有如此重要影响的应用程序被要求是强大的。根本不允许出现任何形式的故障，这将意味着人们被拒绝进入我们的国家，甚至在边境被驱逐出境!测试是Quarkus开发生命周期中的第一等公民，这使我们能够在最短的时间内提高应用程序的稳健性和信心。在生产环境下测试应用程序就像用@QuarkusTest注释测试类和用@QuarkusTestResource和TestContainers处理数据库一样容易。我们能够实现非常高的代码覆盖率，（最重要的是）不仅仅是在简单的路径上，而是深入到应用程序的每一部分。这对该应用程序从首次部署和向公众开放的那一刻起就实现了100%的正常运行时间和可用性起到了巨大的作用。"

msgid "We valued the versatility of a Quarkus application’s configuration, based on the Microprofile Config API, which uses a unified configuration convention and offers the ability to plug in dynamic configuration sources easily. It assisted us a lot with our project, which included many dynamically and rapidly changing parts, such as cap limits for specific country entry points or requirements from passengers coming from particular countries to carry a negative RT-PCR test with them. One of our platform’s primary functions was the accurate, on-time data dispatch to concerned government parties. Using the dynamic configuration capabilities, we could quickly isolate, pause, and resume on demand the integration parts that started accumulating failures due to 3rd party handling errors."
msgstr "我们很重视Quarkus应用程序配置的多功能性，它基于Microprofile Config API，使用统一的配置约定，并提供轻松插入动态配置源的能力。它对我们的项目帮助很大，其中包括许多动态和快速变化的部分，如特定国家入境点的上限限制或来自特定国家的乘客要求携带阴性RT-PCR测试。我们平台的主要功能之一是准确、及时地将数据发送至相关政府机构。利用动态配置功能，我们可以快速隔离、暂停并按需恢复因第三方处理错误而开始积累故障的集成部分。"

msgid "A website that must be visited by every person entering Greece, especially during the tourist season, is - as can be easily guessed - quite high traffic. There were thousands of concurrent unique users at any point in time, with many thousands of forms submitted per day. We needed the application to handle most of the traffic with minimal resources, as well as being able to scale out if/when required, such as during midnight, when the results from EVA came in and the platform needed to process with extreme urgency the final form for each passenger, generating the QR code and the accompanying PDF file with all the form information and submit it via email. Quarkus minimal resource usage allowed us to scale to 2 c5.large (2 vcpus and 4GB memory) AWS EC2 instances for the vast majority of the time, with CPU usage usually under 10%. During QR code generation time, the platform scaled out to 4 c5.large EC2 instances, with CPU usage around 80%, while handling more than 10000 QR codes/PDF/emails per minute."
msgstr "一个每个进入希腊的人都必须访问的网站，特别是在旅游季节，--很容易猜到--流量相当大。在任何时候都有成千上万的并发独立用户，每天有成千上万的表格提交。我们需要应用程序以最小的资源来处理大部分的流量，并且能够在需要时进行扩展，例如在午夜时分，当EVA的结果出来时，平台需要极其紧急地处理每个乘客的最终表格，生成二维码和附带的包含所有表格信息的PDF文件并通过电子邮件提交。Quarkus最小的资源使用量使我们在绝大多数时间里可以扩展到2个c5.large（2个vcpus和4GB内存）AWS EC2实例，CPU使用率通常低于10%。在二维码生成时间，该平台扩展到4个c5.large EC2实例，CPU使用率约为80%，同时每分钟处理超过10000个二维码/PDF/邮件。"

msgid "We served about 4M PLFs - from July to September - from travelers coming from almost every country of the world. The forms were accompanied by their respective email notifications, PDFs, and QR codes during the high summer season providing tourists with low-risk access to the country, efficient risk management and optimal allocation of covid-19 test resources, locking in at high-risk countries as fast as possible, as well as providing early warnings for destinations. At the same time, we communicate with ten different information systems feeding them valuable information about passengers, without downtime or performance degradation. We supported the difficult job of health experts. Hence, they got the right decisions for the country, and we were there when the information was necessary to confine the spread of the virus to the community. It was and still is an exciting and, at the same time, a stressful journey that shows the unique role technology can play for solving very crucial problems for society."
