msgid "Using Quarkus greatly improved our developers productivity and our CI/CD process needed to be redesigned to catch up. In doing so, we wanted a more universal experience and leveraging Quarkus extensions was a perfect fit. Every step of our Quarkus pipelines, from inception, to development through deployment, and finally monitoring, are now orchestrated through GitLab."
