msgid "Let's imagine you have an application deployed in Kubernetes and exposing an HTTP API. You declare a Kubernetes service that delegates the calls to your application. This service acts as a proxy in front of a set of pods (often application replicas). When another application calls our HTTP API, it uses DNS to locate the Kubernetes service and uses the resolved address. It's important to understand that it does not locate and call the application instance but the Kubernetes service. This service then delegates the call to the actual application and implements a round-robin when there are multiple replicas."
