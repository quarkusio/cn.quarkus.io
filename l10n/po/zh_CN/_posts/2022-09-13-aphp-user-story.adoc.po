Dealing with every single medical specialty, it is sometimes difficult to find every needed tool on the market. That’s where the DSN/DEV intervene, creating ultra specialized micro apps.  With all these heterogeneous apps, the APHP faces multiple challenges in terms of communication. Once again it is the DSN/DEV job to ensure that every single part is able to communicate properly with each other, regardless of their nature and function. In doing so their job naturally requires mastery over the data stream and the ability to manipulate it in real time."

msgid "For that last part, our choices leaned toward WildFly/JBoss. We chose to package our applications in a single deliverable containing front end and back end due to the small size and to facilitate deployment. Our front end is rarely evolving, or to be more exact it evolves only when the back end is doing so. This allows our teams to quickly deploy new features. The size of our Information Network (hundreds of major apps and thousands of working instances) makes it so its global evolution is slow paced."
msgstr "对于这最后一部分，我们的选择倾向于WildFly/JBoss。我们选择将我们的应用程序打包成一个包含前端和后端的交付物，因为它体积小，便于部署。我们的前端很少进化，或者更确切地说，只有当后端在进化的时候才会进化。这使我们的团队能够快速部署新的功能。我们的信息网络的规模（几百个主要的应用程序和几千个工作实例）使得它的全球进化是慢节奏的。"

We wanted an evolution and not a revolution."

This tool was based on the servlet specification, and over its 10 years of existence a heavy stratification took place.

We could try to develop a replacement and if we encountered any unexpected obstacle we could go back to the existing app."
