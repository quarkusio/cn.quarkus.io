Super linkage is always done eagerly at the point where the subclass has just been loaded. That is because it is not possible to use a subclass to create instances or execute methods without knowing how the superclass is defined. By contrast, field and method linkage is done lazily. In these cases linkage happens as a side-effect of execution. When a method executes a field get/put or method invoke bytecode for the first time the target field or method is looked up via its owner class, loading it if necessary. The field type or method signature is checked for consistency and details of where to find the field or how to call the method are cached, allowing the next execution of the bytecode to bypass the linkage step."
