There is a brand new command mode with probably more stuff coming up. So that's also a subject we can definitely dive into so people understand how to do command mode. Can you add it to an existing Quarkus app... Where does that change stuff? And so on, I did mention Hibernat with Panache. I think there is a lot to discuss around that but Panache is not only about Hibernate it's also about mongodb. So we could get Luic to discuss a bit about that. And also there is a bunch of technology you're using inside Quarkus that you probably are not super expert about... So micro-profile open API Microprofile config is super enough but open API metrics. All of those, I think, would probably deserve one or even more sessions would need to focus and see how that goes. I thought about reactive database connections. So using the reactive drives, and get going. Kafka Streams so we have Gunnar who can address that."

Somebody mentioned whether you could use Axion and Reactor with Quarkus. So, under the hood, we use Vert.x and we use Mutiny for the reactive library. So, reactors is an alternative library, you can use Reactor, especially if you have a driver that is using Reactor you woould that would create two, event loops and so on, potentially, but otherwise it's doable, but the one we really push for is the Mutiny and the alignment on top of Vert.x to get a smaller of a usage as possible.
