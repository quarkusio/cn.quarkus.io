msgid "This blog post takes a deep dive into the evolution of SmallRye Stork beyond its initial release, providing a detailed exploration of its fresh additions.  But first, let's describe briefly what Stork can do for you.  SmallRye Stork is a client-side service discovery and selection framework.  It provides out-of-the-box integrations with Kubernetes, Eureka, and Hashicorp Consul, as well as a set of selection strategies, including round-robin, power-of-two-choices and best response time.  But the most noteworthy feature of Stork is its extensibility. You can create your own service selection strategy or plug in your own service discovery mechanism.  If you don't know it yet, a good way to get started is to take a look at our https://quarkus.io/guides/stork[getting started guide]."

#. type: Plain text

msgid "Stork, from the 1.2.0 version, proposes a programmatic API to allow users to define the service discovery and selection configuration through code rather than through declarative or external configuration files. This means that you can use the full expressive power of Java to explicitly specify new service definitions and do manual lookup and selection. This is particularly beneficial when the configuration requirements of an application are not known until runtime, and it provides the ability to adjust settings without restarting the application."
