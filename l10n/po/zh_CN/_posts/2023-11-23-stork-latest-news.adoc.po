"This blog post takes a deep dive into the evolution of SmallRye Stork beyond its initial release, providing a detailed exploration of its fresh additions.\n"
"But first, let's describe briefly what Stork can do for you.\n"
"SmallRye Stork is a client-side service discovery and selection framework.\n"
"It provides out-of-the-box integrations with Kubernetes, Eureka, and Hashicorp Consul, as well as a set of selection strategies, including round-robin, power-of-two-choices and best response time.\n"
"But the most noteworthy feature of Stork is its extensibility. You can create your own service selection strategy or plug in your own service discovery mechanism.\n"
"If you don't know it yet, a good way to get started is to take a look at our https://quarkus.io/guides/stork[getting started guide]."

"Additionally, our documentation has also been enhanced, offering comprehensive guides for both seasoned users and those taking their first steps with Stork.\n"
"To further support your exploration, there is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCNwxPDGt7Q[a video] and supplementary content that show Stork's capabilities in detail, don’t hesitate to check them out.\n"
"Don't have much time? Don't worry, we have the https://www.youtube.com/shorts/F4Gd1I1zfjs[perfect video] to understand Stork in less than 1 minute."

msgstr ""

#: _posts/2023-11-23-stork-latest-news.adoc
msgid ""
"Stork, from the 1.2.0 version, proposes a programmatic API to allow users to define the service discovery and selection configuration through code rather\n"
"than through declarative or external configuration files. This means that you can use the full expressive power of Java to explicitly specify new service\n"
"definitions and do manual lookup and selection. This is particularly beneficial when the configuration requirements of an application are not known until runtime,\n"
"and it provides the ability to adjust settings without restarting the application."

"Users may prefer using a framework that leverages CDI mechanism to easily manage and inject dependencies and have a more testable and maintainable code.\n"
"Stork can now do that. Starting from the 2.0.1 release, users can use the service discovery and load balancer as beans.\n"
"For that, it looks for CDI beans during the initialization in addition to the SPI providers.\n"
"It is worth mentioning that this enhancement also contributes to improving the Quarkus experience."

"Again, to do so, Stork uses https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client/blob/master/extensions/knative/client/src/main/java/io/fabric8/knative/client/KnativeClient.java[Fabric 8 Knative Client] which is just an extension of Fabric8 Kubernetes Client."
