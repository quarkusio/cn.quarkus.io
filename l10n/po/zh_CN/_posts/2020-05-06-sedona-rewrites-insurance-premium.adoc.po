msgid "Sedona responded to a call for tenders (request for proposal) for a calculation engine for a Financial and Insurance French firm, which had been using Microsoft Excel to perform the estimation of insurance premiums and felt that they had reached the point where they were limited by the capabilities of Excel. They wanted to have a more professional, configurable, customizable, and user-friendly tool to be able to gain competitive advantage in the market, higher speed for quotes to end customers, and better end user experience. With their current Excel-based system, every employee had its own Excel sheet, every employee could change their copy of their excel sheets, that could possibly generate different quotes for the same inputs. They wanted to homogenize and standardize these processes making them less error prone."

msgid "Sedona’s proposal was to develop a frontend application interfacing with a backend that would be the actual calculation engine, and a back-office solution to manage the configuration of the calculation engine. The backend calculation engine would perform actuarial analysis for the estimation of insurance premiums. With respect to their client’s requirements, the solution needed to include Docker, fast startup time and small RAM consumption. Their client did not care about the framework they used as long as it was based on Java."

msgid "A couple of years ago, they learned about Eclipse MicroProfile, which they liked and thought it was a very good idea to adopt instead of Spring because MicroProfile was a community-driven Java specification for microservices. They had tried the MicroProfile implementation by Thorntail and had gained experience implementing microservices using this technology. Another reason they considered MicroProfile was because they wanted to standardize on a single technology stack and avoid having their developers mix technology stacks: one using Spring Boot, another one using Micronaut, for example. So, these were the most salient reasons why they decided to use MicroProfile."

In due diligence, they researched Quarkus on the internet for comparisons of Quarkus and other technologies. They also tried different starter projects from GitHub for all these technologies: Micronaut, Thorntail, SparkJava, Quarkus. After a thorough evaluation, the reasons why they selected Quarkus were as follows:"

One more reason was the fact that _“the Red Hat developers working on Quarkus had expertise with MicroProfile and this was an extra plus for Sedona”_, Edouard asserted."

msgid "The calculation engine can be seen as a microservice exposing REST endpoints. Sedona had been working on this architecture pattern for a few years.  Microservices are usually run in containers, so the issues of deliverability with a small footprint (~75MB) and fast start up (<2s) are important considerations. Sedona used to work on Spring but this framework seemed too heavy, too resource consuming, and above all, it is not a Java standard."

"_“At the beginning, it was a little bit hard to use Quarkus. But after a couple of months of use, I think it’s a good framework, easy to use and fast on the bootstrap and live reload. I particularly liked the data access overlay (Panache) which allows to perform any database reading operation without writing SQL including slightly more complex queries without altering performance even on large volumes of data. The REST client will be very appreciated with the next version of Quarkus. As Quarkus innovates, I will continue to learn and exploit its benefits and better understand all its possibilities”_.\n"
