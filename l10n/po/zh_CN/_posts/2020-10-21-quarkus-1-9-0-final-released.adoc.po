In the beginning, we were adding all extensions to the core Quarkus repository, but eventually it became too much of an overhead or just not always sensible to include an extension into the core.  Some have since then created their own repositories external to Quarkus, but others just never happened because not everyone wants the overhead of maintaining a build setup while in other cases we actually had an idea for an extension but not solidified enough yet to be included in core (and consequently failed to find other community members interested and eager to help)."
