"https://quarkus.io[Quarkus] has come a long way in the _observability_ space. Initial support for Tracing and Metrics\n"
"came from MicroProfile and their respective implementations,\n"
"https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-opentracing/[SmallRye OpenTracing] and\n"
"https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-metrics/[SmallRye Metrics]. Because the observability space evolved, these\n"
"implementations expanded beyond the original specifications, and the Quarkus extensions providing Tracing and Metrics\n"
"have been heavily used."

"Our goal with Quarkus is always to offer the best technologies and embrace the state of the practice to get the job\n"
"done. It was true for both https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-opentracing/[SmallRye OpenTracing] and\n"
"https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-metrics/[SmallRye Metrics], but we now believe there are better alternatives to\n"
