We have seen how to achieve this with https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-and-web-ui-development-mode/[Angular] but what about React which at least according to GitHub stars has surpassed Angular in terms of popularity? It is all about choice and I will show you how you can not only integrate React but also use a web component framework called https://www.patternfly.org/[Patternfly].  Patternfly is a collection of patterns, components and styles for creating rich, consistent and interactive GUIs."
