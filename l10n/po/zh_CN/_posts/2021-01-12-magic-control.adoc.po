"Just before my PTO, someone told me: '_I don't like magic._'\n"
"In this context, _magic_ refers to the amount of hidden _stuff_ done by Quarkus under the hood for the sake of simplicity.\n"

"It's not the first time that I get that kind of comment, and coming from the Vert.x project, it makes sense.\n"
"Vert.x has (almost) no magic, and for a good reason: too much magic can be terrible and make production tuning utterly expensive.\n"
"Sometimes you want to have more control and avoid unexpected behaviors: execute the code you wrote, and nothing else."
