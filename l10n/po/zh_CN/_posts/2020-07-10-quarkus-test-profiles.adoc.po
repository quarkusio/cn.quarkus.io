msgid "Before we talk about test profiles let's talk briefly about how `@QuarkusTest` annotated tests actually work. The first time one of these tests is run the Quarkus test extension will start Quarkus. Quarkus will then remain running for the duration of the test run. This makes testing very fast, because Quarkus is only started once, however it does limit you to testing a single configuration per module, as you can't restart Quarkus in a different configuration. Test profiles lift this limitation."
