msgid "In another https://quarkus.io/blog/virtual-threads-2/[blog post], we explored how to implement a CRUD application with Quarkus to harness the power of virtual threads.  This post continues from that point, explaining how to containerize the application.  Containerization involves packaging the application into a container image, and we'll use the `quarkus-container-image-jib` extension for this purpose.  Quarkus offers other extensions for containerization, such as `quarkus-container-image-docker`, so choose the one that suits your preference."
