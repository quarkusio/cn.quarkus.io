"This post continues from that point, explaining how to containerize the application.\n"
"Containerization involves packaging the application into a container image, and we'll use the `quarkus-container-image-jib` extension for this purpose.\n"
"Quarkus offers other extensions for containerization, such as `quarkus-container-image-docker`, so choose the one that suits your preference."
