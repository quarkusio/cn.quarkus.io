msgid "Wipro also sees a big opportunity for Quarkus to enable Java developers to create event-driven, serverless applications. Retailers utilize a lot of task processing events as part of batch jobs or real time processing to accept and fulfill orders. “Always on” services are typically used for these tasks and they consume resources even when there is no load.  For example, a retail customer in the United Kingdom receives allocations from a SaaS provider three times a day that utilizes four services running 24x7. By shifting the processing to serverless, the retailer saved significant processing cycles by paying only for the CPU cycles when there is an allocation activity."
msgstr "Wipro还认为Quarkus在使Java开发人员创建事件驱动的无服务器应用程序方面有很大的机会。零售商利用大量的任务处理事件作为批处理工作或实时处理的一部分来接受和完成订单。\"永远在线 \"的服务通常用于这些任务，即使没有负载，它们也会消耗资源。例如，英国的一个零售客户每天从一个SaaS供应商那里收到三次分配，这些分配利用了四个全天候运行的服务。通过将处理转移到无服务器，该零售商节省了大量的处理周期，只在有分配活动时支付CPU周期的费用。"
