"https://datacater.io[DataCater^] is a real-time, cloud-native data pipeline platform based on Apache Kafka and Kubernetes. It allows users to build streaming data pipelines that stream records between different\n"
"Apache Kafka topics and can apply filters or transforms to the records on the way.\n"
"Given its focus on data scientists and data engineers as target users, DataCater enables users\n"
"to develop transforms in Python. It provides an https://www.loom.com/share/15947f13e71540948e3f9d57eac64976[interactive, UI-based preview of streaming data pipelines^]\n"

"DataCater was created in 2020 and initially built its control plane on top of the Scala framework https://www.playframework.com/[Play^] and implemented pipelines with https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/[Kafka Streams^].\n"
"Over time, we experienced the following limitations and issues with the chosen technologies:"
msgstr ""

#: _posts/2023-02-09-datacater-uses-quarkus-to-make-data-streaming-accessible.adoc
msgid "*Inefficient resource usage:* Kafka Streams applications consume a considerable amount of main memory, making it quite expensive to operate at scale."
msgstr ""

#: _posts/2023-02-09-datacater-uses-quarkus-to-make-data-streaming-accessible.adoc
msgid "*Long startup times:* Starting a Kafka Streams application can take up to a few minutes, which has a negative impact on the availability of streaming data pipelines."

msgid ""
"*Restriction to intra-cluster streaming:* By default, Kafka Streams can only stream data between topics of the same Apache Kafka cluster. When facing use cases that stream data between different Kafka clusters, for instance, between a production and test cluster,\n"
"we had to employ additional tooling, e.g., MirrorMaker 2."

"In 2022, we rewrote DataCater to implement lots of learnings that we made when working with early users.\n"

"With Quarkus, we are able to bring the best of cloud native and messaging applications together. Streaming messages, especially in the context of Apache Kafka, is still a Java-dominated environment, while the traditional Java stack lacks the characteristics of cloud-native applications, like small footprints, fast startups, and self-containment.\n"
