"In general, Java web applications use imperative programming combined with blocking IO operations. This is incredibly popular because it is easier to reason about the code.\n"
"Things get executed sequentially. When the application receives a request, the framework associates this request to a worker thread.\n"
"When the request processing needs to interact with a database or another remote service, it relies on blocking IO.\n"
"The thread is blocked waiting for the answer, making the communication synchronous. With this model one request is not affected by another as they are run on different threads.\n"
"Even when one thread is waiting, other requests running on different threads are not slowed down significantly."

"The reactive model uses the hardware resources more efficiently, but... a significant pitfall lurks. If the processing of a request starts to block, things can go south really quickly as\n"
"no other request can be handled. To avoid this, you need to learn how to write asynchronous and non-blocking code, how to schedule operations, how to write continuations, how to chain actions.\n"
"Basically, we need a way to structure asynchronous processing, and use non-blocking IO. No doubt, that consists of a paradigm shift.\n"
"In Quarkus, we want to make the shift as easy as possible, so RESTEasy Reactive allows you to choose whether an endpoint is blocking or non-blocking\n"
"(an application is free to mix and match blocking and non-blocking methods at will).\n"
"So don’t be intimidated by the reactive word, the infrastructure is reactive, but your code can be either reactive or imperative. That’s what we mean by unification of reactive and imperative."
