"一般来说，Java 网络应用程序使用命令式编程，并结合阻塞 IO "

"IO。线程被阻塞等待应答，从而实现同步通信。在这种模式下，一个请求不会受到另一个请求的影响，因为它们是在不同的线程上运行的。即使一个线程在等待，在不同线程上运行的其他请求也不会明显变慢。"

"Quarkus was already providing a way to handle HTTP requests from the IO "
"thread. Reactive Routes provides a declarative model to implement HTTP API. "
"Each route can be called on the IO thread (default) or on a worker thread "
"(using the `@Blocking` annotation).\n"
"Reactive Routes provide very good throughput and performance as highlighted "
"in https://quarkus.io/blog/io-thread-benchmark/[this] article. How does "
"reactive routes compare to RESTEasy Reactive?"

"Quarkus 已经提供了一种从 IO 线程处理 HTTP 请求的方法。Reactive Routes 提供了一个声明式模型来实现 HTTP "
"API。每个路由都可以在 IO 线程（默认）或工作线程（使用 `@Blocking` 注解）上调用。正如 link:https://quarkus.io/"
"blog/io-thread-benchmark/[本文] 所强调的，反应式路由提供了非常好的吞吐量和性能。反应式路由与 RESTEasy "
"Reactive 相比如何？"

"One of the main complaints we got about Reactive Routes was about the "
"development model: it’s very different from the one used with RESTEasy. "
"However, Reactive Routes allowed us to verify the performance and efficiency "
"benefits of using an end-to-end reactive model on top of Quarkus.\n"
"RESTEasy Reactive can be seen as the “next generation”: you get the runtime "
"benefits while also using a familiar development model."
msgstr ""
"我们对 Reactive Routes 的主要抱怨之一是开发模型：它与 RESTEasy 所使用的模型大相径庭。不过，Reactive Routes "
"让我们验证了在 Quarkus 上使用端到端反应模型在性能和效率方面的优势。RESTEasy Reactive 可以看作是 \"下一代 "
"\"产品：在使用熟悉的开发模型的同时，还能获得运行时的优势。"

"RESTEasy Reactive is the next generation of HTTP framework. It unifies "
"reactive (non-blocking IO, asynchronous APIs) and imperative (thanks to the "
"`@Blocking` annotation). It improves raw performances without constraining "
"the user experience.\n"
"Its reactive/imperative duality makes it fit any use cases, from highly "
"concurrent HTTP APIs, to more traditional transactional CRUD applications."
msgstr ""
"RESTEasy Reactive 是下一代 HTTP 框架。它统一了反应式（非阻塞 IO、异步 API）和命令式（得益于 `@Blocking` "
"注解）。它在不限制用户体验的前提下提高了原始性能。它的反应性/操作性二元性使其适用于从高并发 HTTP API 到更传统的事务性 CRUD "
"应用程序的任何用例。"
