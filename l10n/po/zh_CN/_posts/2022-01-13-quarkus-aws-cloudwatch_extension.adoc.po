msgid "We recently had the situation that we wanted to log our Quarkus application logs to AWS CloudWatch. Basically it takes some time but is not a big deal. Adding a CloudWatch dependency, creating a Log Handler and push the logs to CloudWatch via the provided AWS CloudWatch API. But what if you want to share it with others? Of course you could put it on GitHub as part of your project so others can copy and paste it, but that’s not the most elegant way to share code with others."
msgstr "我们最近遇到了这样的情况，我们想把我们的Quarkus应用日志记录到AWS CloudWatch。基本上这需要一些时间，但不是什么大问题。添加一个CloudWatch的依赖关系，创建一个日志处理程序，通过提供的AWS CloudWatch API将日志推送到CloudWatch。但如果你想和别人分享呢？当然，你可以把它作为项目的一部分放在GitHub上，这样别人就可以复制和粘贴它，但这并不是与他人分享代码的最优雅的方式。"

"That’s why we implemented a Quarkus extension so others can use it more easily and don’t need to reinvent the wheel or need to copy paste things around.\n"
"How do I do that? Here the Quarkiverse Hub comes in. Quarkiverse is a GitHub organization where developers can host and share their extension with others. There are several benefits you get for free when hosting the extension in Quarkiverse instead of using the good old way of doing all the things on your own. By using Quarkiverse you don’t need to build the artifact, release it with the Sonatype Nexus Manager (or something similar) and distribute it on Maven Central and other repositories.\n"
"Quarkiverse comes with all these things so you can focus on implementing the extension itself. The following post describes what needs to be done to initialize, implement and share a CloudWatch Quarkus extension."

"If you want to use Quarkiverse to publish your extension on the Hub (which is what we recommend) and make use of all the advantages you get by using it, you simply need to open a new extension proposal issue in the quarkusio/quarkus GitHub organization. By doing this, most of the requirements are fulfilled already as there will be a template generated for you and you just have to implement your extension code. In case you are using an existing project as template, there are some requirements you need to take care of.\n"

"This article covers the runtime and deployment content only as the other things are optional, generated by the project template already or even important, but not the most important and pragmatic thing when you want to learn how a Quarkus extension can be created.\n"
"Let’s start with the deployment section. It contains classes needed for the initialization of the Quarkus extension. Without this initialization class, your extension won’t be identified when starting your Quarkus application."

"In the snippet above you can see a _feature()_ method which is annotated with _@BuildStep_ and returns a new FeatureBuildItem. It exposes the name of the feature (logging-cloudwatch) displayed in the log during application bootstrap.\n"
"The second method _addCloudWatchHandler()_ initializes the extensions runtime configurations provided by the LoggingCloudWatchConfig and LoggingCloudWatchHandlerValueFactory class. Luckily there is a LogHandlerBuildItem provided, so we can overwrite the existing log handler by adding our own implementation. There are lots of other BuildItems provided so it’s definitely worth it, taking a look at it if you want to create your own extension. The parameter of this method is a config class which will be described in the following snippet."

"The _LoggingCloudWatchConfig_ is building the bridge between the extension itself and the Quarkus application which uses the extension. It’s combining the _application.properties entries_ in the Quarkus application with our extension. That means with this class you can define the properties available in the _application.properties_ file and make the extension configurable from the outside.\n"
"The _@ConfigRoot_ defines the prefix of the property in the _application.properties_ and the _@ConfigItems_ is the postfix. One application.properties entry we are accepting with this class is log.cloudwatch.enabled for example."

msgid "The LoggingCloudWatchHandlerValueFactory is the glue between the actually business logic of the extension: dealing with application logs and putting these logs to AWS and the configurations of the _application.properties_ file mentioned before. As you can see in the _create()_ method, configuration entries are checked and used for initializing the CloudWatch connection."
msgstr "LoggingCloudWatchHandlerValueFactory是扩展的实际业务逻辑之间的粘合剂：处理应用程序的日志并将这些日志放到AWS和前面提到的 _application.properties_ 文件的配置。正如你在 _create()_ 方法中看到的，配置项被检查并用于初始化CloudWatch连接。"

"Now that we have made the extension configurable for the extension users by adding _application.properties_ entries, exposing the extension name and providing the configurations to the handler class which creates the AWS CloudWatch objects needed to put log messages in AWS CloudWatch, we only need to add one missing piece.\n"
"The Log Handler itself. In the snippet above, in the _LoggingCloudWatchHandlerValueFactory_ we created it already and returned it as a RuntimeValue which we are using in the _LoggingCloudwatchProcessor_ class. That’s the call chain needed to overwrite the existing default log handler."

"This log handler is a java.util.LogHandler which takes the LogRecord object as a parameter of the publish method which will be called when writing a log in an application. For example like log.info(“I Love Open Source!”);. If configured correctly, this log handler will be called when writing logs. As we want to put the log messages in AWS CloudWatch, we need to add the logic for doing it.\n"
"Therefore we create an InputLogEvent and call _putLogEvents()_ which puts the log message to CloudWatch. That’s basically it."

msgid "After doing all these things, the only thing missing is releasing a version of the extension. This can be done by opening a Pull Request which updates the current-version and _next-version_ entry of the _project.yml_ file in the _.github_ folder. After merging this Pull Request, some GitHub Actions will be triggered which will bring your new version to Maven Central and finally others can use your extension as well :-)"
msgstr "做完这些事情后，唯一缺少的就是发布扩展的版本。这可以通过打开一个Pull Request来实现，它可以更新 _.github_ 文件夹中 _project.yml_ 文件的当前版本和 _下一版本_ 条目。合并该拉动请求后，会触发一些GitHub动作，将你的新版本带到Maven中心，最后其他人也可以使用你的扩展 :-)"
