msgid "Biasing can be big win when a potentially concurrent data structure is actually used sequentially. The case where it helps most is exemplified in the problem we already found in class `DataOutputStream`. Normally only one thread writes a `DataOutputStream` and it is often not read until the stream has been filled. All the same, every `putInt()` or `putLong()`` call invokes a syncrhonized method to increment the byte count by 4 or 8.  That's needed just in case some other thread might want to reliably locate the end of the valid buffer data but that rarely happens. So, the unbiased case suffers lock write and cache drain delays at every basic put operation."

msgid "The implementation of biased locking adds a great deal of complexity to the JVM and is understood by only a small subset of the most experienced engineers. The cost of maintaining it and designing around it is significantly slowing down progress on new features. It has been a long term goal to remove it if at all possible. Some OpenJDK contributors wanted to remove it right away in jdk15 others argue for a slower deprecation route in order to check that we could really dispense with it."

At this stage we are making no assumption that the removal of biased locking will definitely make performance worse. We know that in some cases not having biased locks will improve performance. Our concern is to find cases, like the JDK examples above, where it might cause serious performance degradation and get an idea of how bad, and also how common, the worst cases might be."
