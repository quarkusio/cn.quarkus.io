"ArC made an obvious choice: it will not support Portable Extensions, it will "

"This decision opened the door to pruning some ancient CDI features that have "

"bound using the `@Interceptors` annotation, enablement using `beans.xml`, "
"and so on.\n"
"Some other features are not a good fit for the build-time approach either: "
"the notion of explicit bean archives, `InterceptionFactory`, or some parts "
"of the `BeanManager` API.\n"

"Quarkus-specific integration."

"ArC 做出了一个显而易见的选择：它将不支持可移植扩展（Portable Extensions），不是一个完全兼容的 CDI 实现，也不会通过 CDI "

"`@Interceptors` 注释绑定的拦截器、使用 `beans.xml` 的启用等等。还有一些特性也不适合构建时方法：显式 Bean 档案的概念、 "
"`InterceptionFactory` 或 `BeanManager` API 的某些部分。这听起来似乎是一个很长的列表，但事实上，在编写了 "
"Quarkus 特定的集成之后，CDI 的实现已经 \"恰到好处\"，可以运行大量基于 CDI 的现有库和框架。"
