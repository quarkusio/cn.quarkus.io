msgid "Java is used by millions of developers worldwide and is the second most popular language, and they all need a Java runtime. Adoptium, the most popular Java distribution, needed to offer a way for developers to programmatically discover and access pre-built Java binaries across many different variants, and produced an end-user API with Quarkus to improve performance and developer productivity."

There are many distributions of the Java runtime and development kit, but the Eclipse Temurin (formerly known as AdoptOpenJDK) distribution has proven to be the https://snyk.io/jvm-ecosystem-report-2021/[most popular^]. Recently, the AdoptOpenJDK project was moved into the Eclipse Foundation as https://adoptium.net/[Eclipse Adoptium^]. The goal of Adoptium is to promote and support high-quality, TCK certified runtimes and associated technology for use across the Java ecosystem. It does this by performing regular builds, tests, certifications, and of course serving binaries to those millions of developers that need to evaluate, prototype, and run production workloads with Java. Like other open source Eclipse projects, the team behind the distribution API are mostly volunteers, so they are constantly looking for optimizations of their time and resources and technology used to deliver on their mission."

msgid "While developers can download distributions directly from the https://adoptium.net/[Adoptium website^] with a single click, it becomes more of a challenge to automate this process, for example in a CI/CD pipeline. This is especially true due to the number of variants of Java versions, release types, operating systems, architectures, JVM implementations, etc. To that end, Adoptium needed to offer a way to programmatically discover and access pre-built binaries based on these variables, and produced https://api.adoptium.net/q/swagger-ui/[an end-user API^]."

In addition, Adoptium does not have a traditional datacenter, so all of this runs in the cloud on Microsoft Azure, where costs can increase when you have continuously running workloads that take up unnecessary space."

msgid "In 2017, the technical team’s first attempt at exposing an API was using Node.js + Express. As the request volume and number of distribution variants rose, the team found that the response times were getting slower, not only due to the volume, but also due to architectural choices made early on. In particular, the application’s monolithic architecture, where the frontend and backend were in the same app, would cause apparent slowness in the frontend, while the backend processed concurrent requests. In addition, lack of pagination in the API meant that requests could return huge results, even when only the first few elements of the result were needed."

They were especially interested in Quarkus’ promise of stellar performance and smaller footprint, which is comparable to Node.js and even Golang. Even better, Quarkus’ https://quarkus.io/guides/kotlin[first class support for Kotlin^] meant the team could re-use both their Java and Kotlin experience with Quarkus."

msgid "We initially wanted sub-second response times for most of the API, and be able to handle around 10 thousand requests per second. With zero optimizations, our app was responding within 1ms for most APIs, and easily surpassed our throughput requirements. This is way more than we will need for the foreseeable future. The Quarkus app also uses less than half the CPU time [compared to Node.js], despite handling more traffic and providing more functionality."
