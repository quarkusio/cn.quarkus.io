msgid "In the last 3 years, AVIATAR business has been growing fast and they needed to accommodate the growing demand from their customers. To this end, they had to grow their development force from 5 developers when they first started to over 100 at present. As they grew, they realized that one single large team was not the most productive and efficient way to organize their software development efforts because many developers had to spend time waiting for each other’s work to be finished due to the many interdependencies in the overall system. To address this situation, they decided to split development from one team to several cross-functional teams. At the same time, they also started working on ways to make the newly created smaller development teams more independent by giving each team autonomy to run their own services. This resulted in their evolution into a microservices architecture, where most of their microservices were based on Spring Boot and Java EE. They have gone from 10 services in the beginning to over 100 as of this writing."
msgstr "在过去的3年中，AVIATAR的业务一直在快速增长，他们需要适应客户不断增长的需求。为此，他们不得不将他们的开发力量从刚开始的5名开发人员发展到目前的100多人。随着他们的成长，他们意识到，一个单一的大团队并不是组织他们软件开发工作的最富有成效的方式，因为由于整个系统中有许多相互依赖的关系，许多开发人员不得不花时间等待对方的工作完成。为了解决这种情况，他们决定将开发工作从一个团队分成几个跨职能的团队。同时，他们也开始研究如何使新成立的小型开发团队更加独立，给每个团队以自主权来运行他们自己的服务。这导致他们演变成一个微服务架构，其中大部分的微服务是基于Spring Boot和Java EE的。他们从一开始的10个服务到现在的100多个。"

msgid "Lufthansa Technik run their microservices on OpenShift on Azure and, as they were looking at different ways to scale their development efforts, they were also looking at ways to save cloud resource consumption. As they were migrating to microservices, they noticed microservices were consuming high memory and compute cloud resources. For high-availability and emergency procedure purposes, they run at least 3 instances of each microservice on the cloud which means that for each of these microservices, there’s a 3x cloud resource consumption rate. For example, one of their microservices was consuming ½ core plus 1 GB of RAM per instance, which required 1.5 cores and 3 GB of RAM when running it in HA on the cloud (3 instances)."

msgid "Thorsten Pohl, Product Owner Automation & Platform Architect at Digital Product Division AVIATAR, first heard about Quarkus and its benefits in April 2019 at Red Hat Summit. Among its many benefits, the ones that piqued his interest were its low memory consumption and fast times to first response, both in JVM and native modes. He took this information back to AVIATAR and they decided to try it out. There were two initial microservices that their Technology Council recommended for a Quarkus tryout. The first one would be a brand new microservice called the _“Customer Configuration”_ service, and the second one would be the _“Service Discovery”_ service which would be a migration from a service running in an application server to Quarkus."

msgid "The Service Discovery service is used to allow automatic discovery between the microservices AVIATAR consist of. It is considered high risk because if it breaks down, it would have a major impact on customers. Also, the original version of this service ran in production as a highly available service in an application server, consuming a lot of cloud resources. The Quarkus version of this service has been running in native mode in Development for about 3 months with no problems and on January 18, 2020, it was deployed to production to replace the instance running on the application server. It should also be mentioned that this Quarkus service started in JVM mode because it was using MongoDB and there was no MongoDB client Quarkus extension when its development started. But as soon as the MongoDB client Quarkus extension became available, they were able to switch the entire service to native mode. This speaks to the fast innovation and new contributions that are part of the Quarkus open source community project."
msgstr "服务发现服务被用来允许在AVIATAR组成的微服务之间自动发现。它被认为是高风险的，因为如果它发生故障，将对客户产生重大影响。另外，该服务的原始版本作为应用服务器中的高可用服务在生产中运行，消耗了大量的云资源。这个服务的Quarkus版本已经在开发部以本地模式运行了大约3个月，没有出现任何问题，在2020年1月18日，它被部署到生产中，以取代在应用服务器上运行的实例。还应该提到的是，这个Quarkus服务是以JVM模式开始的，因为它使用的是MongoDB，而且在其开发开始时还没有MongoDB客户端Quarkus扩展。但是当MongoDB客户端Quarkus扩展可用时，他们就能将整个服务切换到本地模式。这说明了Quarkus开源社区项目的快速创新和新贡献。"

msgid "Lufthansa Technik sees Quarkus as a great fit in their journey to running their services in a serverless mode. They have many services that aren’t invoked that often but they still need to have 3 instances of each up and running all the time for high-availability requirements leading to high cloud resource consumption costs. They plan to turn these seldom accessed services to Function-as-a-service calls so that they can be invoked on demand leading to a reduction of cloud. If they were using Spring Boot, it would take too long to boot up, making it prohibitive to use in a serverless mode."
msgstr "汉莎技术公司认为Quarkus在他们以无服务器模式运行服务的过程中非常合适。他们有很多服务并不经常被调用，但为了满足高可用性的要求，他们仍然需要每个服务有3个实例一直在运行，导致云资源消耗成本很高。他们计划将这些很少被访问的服务变成 \"功能即服务 \"的调用，这样他们就可以按需调用，从而减少云的消耗。如果他们使用Spring Boot，启动时间会太长，使其无法在无服务器模式下使用。"

msgid "Among the many benefits that Quarkus provides to Lufthansa Technik, Thorsten mentioned that _“they could cut cloud resource costs threefold.\"_ And the same goes with OpenShift because of the higher density you can achieve on each core using Quarkus. For example, they had a microservice that was consuming ½ core plus 1 GB of RAM per instance, which required 1.5 cores and 3 GB of RAM when running it in HA on the cloud (3 instances). When using the Quarkus version of the same microservice, its consumption was of 200 millicores plus 200-400 MB of RAM per instance. This translates to 0.6 cores plus 600 MB – 1.2 GB of RAM for an HA deployment of 3 instances of the microservice _“. They could run 3 times denser deployments without sacrificing availability and response times of services”_, Thornsten reiterated. These are the types of optimizations that can only be achieved by the symbiotic combination of Quarkus and GraalVM."
msgstr "在Quarkus为汉莎技术公司提供的众多好处中，Thorsten提到， _\"他们可以将云资源成本降低三倍\"。_ 而OpenShift也是如此，因为使用Quarkus，你可以在每个核心上实现更高的密度。例如，他们有一个微服务，每个实例消耗核心加1GB内存，在云上以HA方式运行时（3个实例），需要1.5个核心和3GB内存。当使用同一微服务的Quarkus版本时，它的消耗是每个实例200毫核加200-400MB的RAM。这相当于0.6个内核加600MB？对于微服务的3个实例的HA部署，1.2GB的RAM _。他们可以在不牺牲服务的可用性和响应时间的情况下运行3倍的密集部署？T_ hornsten重申了这一点。这些是只有通过Quarkus和GraalVM的共生组合才能实现的优化类型。"

"Thorsten also described Quarkus live coding capabilities as a _“really good thing”_. Many of their applications have web-based user interfaces and _“making changes and reloading pages instantaneously is a great feature”_, Thorsten affirmed.\n"
"Another benefit, already mentioned earlier, was the small Quarkus learning curve experienced by their developers, who are Spring Boot developers with Java EE experience. What makes this possible is the stack of technologies included in Quarkus, composed of best-of-breed and familiar technologies for Kubernetes-native microservices. Some of the Quarkus extensions used by the AVIATAR developers are: Java Web Token (JWT), JAX-RS, MongoDB client, MicroProfile Rest Client, Keycloak (security), Hibernate ORM (for relational databases), MicroProfile Metrics, and MicroProfile Health Check."
