msgid "Quarkus extension dependencies are usually configured in the same way as any other project dependencies in the project's build file, e.g. the Maven `pom.xml` or the Gradle build scripts. However, there are dependency types that aren't yet supported out-of-the-box by Maven and Gradle. What we refer here to as \"conditional dependencies\" is one example."

msgid "The idea behind the notion of the conditional dependency is that such a dependency must be activated only if a certain condition is satisfied. If the condition is not satisfied then the dependency **must not** be activated. In that regard, conditional dependencies can be categorized as optional, i.e. they may or may not appear in the resulting set of project dependencies."

msgid "In which cases could conditional dependencies be useful? A typical example would be a component that should be activated **only** in case all of its required dependencies are available. If one or more of the component's required dependencies aren't available, instead of failing, the component should simply not be activated."

In other words, the presence of `quarkus-extension-c` is the condition which, if satisfied, enables `quarkus-extension-b` during the build of a Quarkus application."
