msgid "In the _initialization_ phase the preparatory work is being carried out and custom contexts are registered.  _Bean discovery_ is then the process where the container analyzes all application classes, identifies beans and wires them all together based on the provided metadata.  Subsequently, the extensions can register _synthetic components_.  Attributes of these components are fully controlled by the extensions, i.e. are not derived from an existing class.  Finally, the _deployment is validated_.  For example, the container validates every injection point in the application and fails the build if there is no bean that satisfies the given required type and qualifiers."

The initial metadata are read from the _bean archive index_, an immutable https://github.com/wildfly/jandex[Jandex index, window=\"_blank\"] which is built from various sources during <<cdi-reference.adoc#bean_discovery,bean discovery>>.  However, extensions can add, remove or transform the metadata at certain stages of the bootstrap.  Moreover, extensions can also register <<synthetic_beans,synthetic components>>.
