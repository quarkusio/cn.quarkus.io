msgid "Quarkus supports a feature called Dev Services that allows you to create various datasources without any config.  What that means practically, is that if you have docker running and have not configured `quarkus.redis.hosts`, Quarkus will automatically start a Redis container when running tests or dev-mode, and automatically configure the connection."
