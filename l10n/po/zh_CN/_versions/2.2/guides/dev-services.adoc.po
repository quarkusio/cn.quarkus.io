msgid "Quarkus supports the automatic provisioning of unconfigured services in development and test mode. We refer to this capability as Dev Services. From a developers perspective this means that if you include an extension and don't configure it then Quarkus will automatically start the relevant service (usually using https://www.testcontainers.org/[Testcontainers] behind the scenes) and wire up your application to use this service."

msgid "All this functionality is part of the Quarkus `deployment` modules, so does not affect the production application in any way. If you want to disable all Dev Services you can use the `quarkus.devservices.enabled=false` config property, although in most cases this is not necessary as simply configuring the service will result in the Dev Service being disabled automatically."
