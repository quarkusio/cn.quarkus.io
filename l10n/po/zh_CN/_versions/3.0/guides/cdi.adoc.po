Subsequently, a bean is assignable to an injection point if the bean has a bean type that matches the _required type_ and has all the _required qualifiers_.  We'll talk about qualifiers later.

However, a full CDI implementation is not used under the hood.  Quarkus only implements a subset of the CDI features - see also <<cdi-reference.adoc#supported_features,the list of supported features>> and <<cdi-reference.adoc#limitations,the list of limitations>>.  On the other hand, there are quite a few <<cdi-reference#nonstandard_features,non-standard features>> and <<cdi-reference.adoc#build_time_apis,Quarkus-specific APIs>>.  We believe that our efforts will drive the innovation of the CDI specification towards the build-time oriented developer stacks in the future."
