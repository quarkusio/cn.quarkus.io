It starts a Keycloak container for both the dev and/or test modes and initializes them by registering the existing Keycloak realm or creating a new realm with the client and users for you to start developing your Quarkus application secured by Keycloak immediately. It will restart the container when the `application.properties` or the realm file changes have been detected."
