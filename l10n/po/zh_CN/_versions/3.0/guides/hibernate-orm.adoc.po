Creating an application-scoped bean that implements this interface and annotating it with `@PersistenceUnitExtension` (or `@PersistenceUnitExtension(\"nameOfYourPU\")` for a <<multiple-persistence-units,named persistence unit>>)  will replace the current Quarkus default implementation `io.quarkus.hibernate.orm.runtime.tenant.DataSourceTenantConnectionResolver`.  Your custom connection resolver would allow for example to read tenant information from a database and create a connection per tenant at runtime based on it."
