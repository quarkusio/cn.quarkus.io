This increases demand on resiliency of applications. To simplify making more resilient applications, Quarkus provides https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-fault-tolerance/[SmallRye Fault Tolerance], an implementation of the https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-fault-tolerance/[MicroProfile Fault Tolerance] specification."
