"In the _initialization_ phase the preparatory work is being carried out and custom contexts are registered.\n"
"_Bean discovery_ is then the process where the container analyzes all application classes, identifies beans and wires them all together based on the provided metadata.\n"
"Subsequently, the extensions can register _synthetic components_.\n"
"Attributes of these components are fully controlled by the extensions, i.e. are not derived from an existing class.\n"
"Finally, the _deployment is validated_.\n"
"For example, the container validates every injection point in the application and fails the build if there is no bean that satisfies the given required type and qualifiers."
