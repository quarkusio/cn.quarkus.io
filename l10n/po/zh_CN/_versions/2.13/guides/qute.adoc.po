"Qute is a templating engine designed specifically to meet the Quarkus needs.\n"
"The usage of reflection is minimized to reduce the size of native images.\n"
"The API combines both the imperative and the non-blocking reactive style of coding.\n"
"In the development mode, all files located in `src/main/resources/templates` are watched for changes and modifications are immediately visible.\n"
"Furthermore, we try to detect most of the template problems at build time.\n"
"In this guide, you will learn how to easily render templates in your application."
