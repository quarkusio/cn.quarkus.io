"Quarkus Security uses `HttpAuthenticationMechanism` to extract the authentication credentials from the HTTP request and delegates them to `IdentityProvider` to convert the credentials to `SecurityIdentity`.\n"

"When an authentication request is rejected by Quarkus Security, `HttpAuthenticationMechanism` sends an authentication challenge back to the client.\n"
