In this scenario, it is worse than useless to have thousands of threads if we have tens of CPU cores, virtual threads won't enhance the performance of CPU-bound workloads.  Even worse, when running a CPU-bound workload on a virtual thread, the virtual thread monopolizes the carrier thread on which it is mounted.  It will either reduce the chance for the other virtual thread to run or will start creating new carrier threads, leading to high memory usage."

Also, there are situations where the virtual thread cannot be unmounted from the carrier thread.  This is called **pinning**.  Finally, some libraries use `ThreadLocal` to store and reuse objects.

For each of them, the object stored in the `ThreadLocal` is created (often large and expensive) and won't be reused, as the virtual thread is not pooled (and won't be used to run another task once the execution completes).  This problem leads to high memory usage.  Unfortunately, it requires sophisticated code changes in the libraries themselves."
