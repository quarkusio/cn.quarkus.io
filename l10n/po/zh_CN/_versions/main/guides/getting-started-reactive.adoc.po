msgid "In the traditional and imperative approach, frameworks assign a thread to handle the request.  So, the whole processing of the request runs on this worker thread.  This model does not scale very well.  Indeed, to handle multiple concurrent requests, you need multiple threads; and so your application concurrency is constrained by the number of threads.  In addition, these threads are blocked as soon as your code interacts with remote services.  So, it leads to inefficient usage of the resources, as you may need more threads, and each thread, as they are mapped to OS threads, has a cost in terms of memory and CPU."

A minimal amount of threads called I/O threads, can handle many concurrent I/O.  With such a model, request processing is not delegated to a worker thread but uses these I/O threads directly.It saves memory and CPU as there is no need to create worker threads to handle the requests.  It also improves the concurrency as it removes the constraint on the number of threads.  Finally, it also improves response time as it reduces the number of thread switches."

msgid "So, with the reactive execution model, the requests are processed using I/O threads.  But that's not all.  An I/O thread can handle multiple concurrent requests.  How? Here is the trick and one of the most significant differences between reactive and imperative."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: upstream/_versions/main/guides/getting-started-reactive.adoc:78
msgid "When processing a request requires interacting with a remote service, like an HTTP API or a database, it does not block the execution while waiting for the response.  Instead, it schedules the I/O operation and attaches a continuation, i.e., the request processing remaining code.  This continuation can be passed as a callback (a function invoked with the I/O outcome), or use more advanced constructs such as reactive programming or co-routines.  Regardless of how the continuation is expressed, the essential aspect is the release of the I/O thread and, as a consequence, the fact that this thread can be used to process another request.  When the scheduled I/O completes, the I/O thread executes the continuation, and the processing of the pending request continues."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: upstream/_versions/main/guides/getting-started-reactive.adoc:81
msgid "So, unlike the imperative model, where I/O blocks the execution, reactive switches to a continuation-based design, where the I/O threads are released, and continuation invoked when the I/Os complete.  As a result, the I/O thread can handle multiple concurrent requests, improving the overall concurrency of the application."

It’s a problem of protocols not designed for this use case.  So, to stream rows from the database, you need to keep a connection (and sometimes a transaction) open until all the rows are consumed.  If you have slow consumers, you break the golden rule of databases: don’t hold connections for too long.  Indeed, the number of connections is rather low, and having consumers keeping them for too long will dramatically reduce the concurrency of your application.  So, when possible, use a `Uni<List<T>>` and load the content.  If you have a large set of results, implement pagination."
