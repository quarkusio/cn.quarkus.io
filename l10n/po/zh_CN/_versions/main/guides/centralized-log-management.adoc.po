In this guide, we will expose how to send them to an external tool using the `quarkus-logging-gelf` extension that can use TCP or UDP to send logs in the Graylog Extended Log Format (GELF)."

When the second message will arrive to Elasticsearch, it will have a `MessageParam0` parameter with the boolean value `true`, and this will generate an indexing error."
