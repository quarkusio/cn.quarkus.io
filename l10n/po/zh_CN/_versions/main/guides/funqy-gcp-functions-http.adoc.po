msgid "If you want to allow HTTP clients to invoke your Funqy functions on Google Cloud Functions, Quarkus allows you to expose multiple Funqy functions through HTTP deployed as one Google Cloud Function.  This approach does add overhead over the regular Funqy Google Cloud Function integration."

#. type: Plain text

msgid "The Funqy HTTP + Google Cloud Functions binding is not a replacement for REST over HTTP.  Because Funqy needs to be portable across a lot of different protocols and function providers its HTTP binding is very minimalistic and you will lose REST features like linking and the ability to leverage HTTP features like cache-control and conditional GETs.  You may want to consider using Quarkus's JAX-RS, Spring MVC, or Vert.x Web Reactive Route xref:gcp-functions-http.adoc[support] instead.  They also work with Quarkus and Google Cloud Functions."
