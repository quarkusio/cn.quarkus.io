msgid "`@ApplicationScoped` and `@Singleton` beans are always active scopes and as such are easy to deal with - context propagation tasks can work with those beans so long as the CDI container is running.  However, `@RequestScoped` beans are a different story. They are only active for a short period of time which can be bound either to HTTP request or some other request/task when manually activated/deactivated.  In this case user must be aware that once the original thread gets to an end of a request, it will terminate the context, calling `@PreDestroy` on those beans and then clearing them from the context.  Subsequent attempts to access those beans from other threads can result in unexpected behaviour.  It is therefore recommended to make sure all tasks using request scoped beans via context propagation are performed in such a manner that they don't outlive the original request duration."
