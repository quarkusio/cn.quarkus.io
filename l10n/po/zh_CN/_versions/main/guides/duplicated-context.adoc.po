"When using a traditional, blocking, and synchronous framework, processing of each request is performed in a dedicated thread.\n"
"So, the same thread is used for the entire processing.\n"
"You know that this thread will not be used to execute anything else until the completion of the processing.\n"
"When you need to propagate data along the processing, such as the security principal or a trace id, you can use `ThreadLocals`.\n"
"The propagated data is cleared once the processing is complete."

"When using a reactive and asynchronous execution model, you cannot use the same mechanism.\n"
"To avoid using many process threads, and reduce resource usage (and also increase the concurrency of the application), the same thread can be used to handle multiple concurrent processing.\n"

"For example, when you use RESTEasy Reactive or gRPC, Quarkus can invoke your business logic on I/O threads.\n"

"When using the imperative model, Quarkus associates a worker thread to each processing unit (like an HTTP request or a gRPC invocation).\n"
"That thread is dedicated to this specific processing until the processing completes.\n"

"With the reactive model, the code runs on event loop threads.\n"

"That model is particularly efficient (low number of threads) and performant (avoid context switches).\n"
"However, it requires a different development model, and you cannot use _Thread Locals_, as the concurrent requests would see the same value.\n"

"The xref:context-propagation.adoc[MicroProfile Context Propagation] specification addresses this issue.\n"
