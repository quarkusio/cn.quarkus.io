Therefore, many more classes are loaded and build time operations also take place every time a live-reload is performed."

msgid "In contrast, in a production application the main objective for Quarkus is to consume the least amount of memory and startup in the smallest amount of time.  Thus, when running the production application, build time operations are not performed (by definition) and various infrastructure classes needed at build time are not present at all at runtime.  Furthermore, the purpose built ClassLoader that comes with the xref:maven-tooling.adoc#fast-jar[fast-jar] package type ensures that class lookup is done as fast as possible while also keeping the minimum amount of jars in memory."
