The resulting digest is used as a key for AES-256 encryption of the cookie value.  The cookie contains an expiry time as part of the encrypted value, so all nodes in the cluster must have their clocks synchronized.  At one-minute intervals, a new cookie gets generated with an updated expiry time if the session is in use."
