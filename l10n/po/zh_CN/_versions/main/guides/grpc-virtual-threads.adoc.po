"To enable virtual thread support on a service method, simply add the link:{runonvthread}[@RunOnVirtualThread] annotation to the method.\n"
"If the JDK is compatible (Java 19 or later versions - we recommend 21+) then the invocation will be offloaded to a new virtual thread.\n"
"It will then be possible to perform blocking operations without blocking the platform thread upon which the virtual thread is mounted."
