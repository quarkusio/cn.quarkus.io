msgid "Reactive routes propose an alternative approach to implement HTTP endpoints where you declare and chain _routes_.  This approach became very popular in the JavaScript world, with frameworks like Express.Js or Hapi.  Quarkus also offers the possibility to use reactive routes.  You can implement REST API with routes only or combine them with Jakarta REST resources and servlets."

msgid "Reactive Routes were initially introduced to provide a reactive execution model for HTTP APIs on top of the xref:quarkus-reactive-architecture.adoc[Quarkus Reactive Architecture].  With the introduction of xref:resteasy-reactive.adoc[RESTEasy Reactive], you can now implement reactive HTTP APIs and still use Jakarta REST annotations.  Reactive Routes are still supported, especially if you want a more _route-based_ approach, and something closer to the underlying reactive engine."

msgid "Before going further, let's have a look at the HTTP layer of Quarkus.  Quarkus HTTP support is based on a non-blocking and reactive engine (Eclipse Vert.x and Netty).  All the HTTP requests your application receive are handled by _event loops_ (I/O Thread) and then are routed towards the code that manages the request.  Depending on the destination, it can invoke the code managing the request on a worker thread (Servlet, Jax-RS) or use the IO Thread (reactive route).  Note that because of this, a reactive route must be non-blocking or explicitly declare its blocking nature (which would result by being called on a worker thread)."
