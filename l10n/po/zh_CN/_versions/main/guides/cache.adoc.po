msgid "Let's imagine you want to expose in your Quarkus application a REST API that allows users to retrieve the weather forecast for the next three days.  The problem is that you have to rely on an external meteorological service which only accepts requests for one day at a time and takes forever to answer.  Since the weather forecast is updated once every twelve hours, caching the service responses would definitely improve your API performances."
