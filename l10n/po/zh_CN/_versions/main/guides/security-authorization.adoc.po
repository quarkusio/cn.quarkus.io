This means you cannot use `@PermitAll` to open up a path if the path has been blocked using `quarkus.http.auth.` configuration. If you are using JAX-RS you may want to consider using the `quarkus.security.jaxrs.deny-unannotated-endpoints` or `quarkus.security.jaxrs.default-roles-allowed` to set default security requirements instead of HTTP path level matching, as these properties can be overridden by annotations on an individual endpoint."
