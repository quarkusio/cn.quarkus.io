"https://webauthn.guide/[WebAuthn] is an authentication mechanism designed to replace passwords. In short, every\n"

#: _versions/3.2/guides/security-webauthn.adoc

"WebAuthn replaces the password with a proof of identity. In practice, users, instead of having to invent a password,\n"
"store it or remember it, will use a hardware token that will generate a proof of identity specifically for your\n"
"service or website. This can be done by asking users to press their thumb on their phone, or pressing a button\n"
"on a https://www.yubico.com[YubiKey] on a computer."
msgstr ""

#: _versions/3.2/guides/security-webauthn.adoc

"So, when you register your user, you use your browser to enter your user information (username, your name, etc…)\n"
"and instead of typing a password to identify yourself, you click a button which will invoke the WebAuthn browser\n"
"API which will ask you to do something (press a button, use your fingerprint). Then, your browser will generate\n"
"a proof of identity which you can send to your service instead of a password."
msgstr ""

#: _versions/3.2/guides/security-webauthn.adoc
msgid ""
"This proof of identity, when you register, consists mostly in a public key. Actually there's a lot of stuff in\n"
"there but the most interesting is the public key. This public key is not stored on your device, or your browser.\n"
"It is generated especially for the target service (tied to its URI), and derived from the hardware authenticator.\n"
"So the association of the hardware authenticator and the target service will always derive the same private and\n"
"public key pair, none of which are stored anywhere. You can for example, take your YubiKey to another computer\n"
"and it will keep generating the same private/public keys for the same target service."
msgstr ""

"So, when you register, you send (mostly) a public key instead of a password, and the service stores that information\n"

"Then, when you need to log in to that service, instead of typing your password (which doesn't exist, remember?),\n"

"a signature to your service instead of a password. That signature requires the private key that is derived from\n"
"your authenticator hardware and the target service, and so when your service receives it, it can verify that it\n"
"corresponds to the signature of the public key you stored as credentials."
msgstr ""

#: _versions/3.2/guides/security-webauthn.adoc

"So, to recap: registration sends a generated public key instead of a password, and login sends a signature for\n"

"In practice, it's a little more complex, because there needs to be a handshake with the server before you\n"
