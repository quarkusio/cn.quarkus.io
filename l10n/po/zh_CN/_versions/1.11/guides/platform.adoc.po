E.g. http://code.quarkus.io and the Quarkus command line tools consult this descriptor to list, add and remove extensions to/from the project on user's request.  This artifact is also used as a Quarkus platform identifier. When Quarkus tools need to identify the Quarkus platform(s) used in the project, they will analyze the dependency version constraints of the project (the effective list of the managed dependencies from the `dependencyManagement` section in Maven terms) looking for the platform descriptor artifact(s) among them. Given that the platform descriptors are included into the Quarkus platform BOMs, every Quarkus application will inherit the platform descriptor artifact from the imported platform BOM(s) as a dependency version constraint (managed dependency in Maven terms)."

msgid "The classifier matching the version of the platform may look confusing at first. But this is what turns the descriptor into a true \"fingerprint\" of the platform. In both Maven and Gradle, the effective set of the dependency version constraints (or the managed dependencies) is obtained by merging all the imported BOMs and version constraints specified individually in the current project and also its parent(s). The artifact `classifier` is a part of the dependency ID, which could be expressed as `groupId:artifactId:classifier:type`. Which means that if a project is based on a couple of Quarkus platforms (by importing their BOMs), e.g. `io.quarkus:quarkus-universe-bom::pom:1.2.3` and `org.acme:acme-bom::pom:555`, and these two platforms are based on different `io.quarkus:quarkus-bom::pom` versions (which is technically a Quarkus platform in its turn as well), the Quarkus tools will be able to detect this fact and make the user aware of it, since it *might* not be a safe combination. If the descriptor artifact didn't include the classifer containing the version of the platform then the tools wouldn't be able to detect a potentially incompatible mix of different versions of the same platform in the same project."
