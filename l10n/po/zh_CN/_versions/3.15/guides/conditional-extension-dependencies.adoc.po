msgid "Quarkus extension dependencies are usually configured in the same way as any other project dependencies in the project's build file, e.g. the Maven `pom.xml` or the Gradle build scripts. However, there are dependency types that aren't yet supported out-of-the-box by Maven and Gradle. What we refer here to as \"conditional dependencies\" is one example."

msgid "The idea behind the notion of the conditional dependency is that such a dependency must be activated only if a certain condition is satisfied. If the condition is not satisfied then the dependency **must not** be activated. In that regard, conditional dependencies can be categorized as optional, i.e. they may or may not appear in the resulting set of project dependencies."
