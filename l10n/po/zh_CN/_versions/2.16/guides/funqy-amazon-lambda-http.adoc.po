msgstr "如果你想让HTTP客户端调用AWS Lambda上的Funqy函数，Quarkus允许你通过HTTP将多个Funqy函数部署为一个AWS Lambda。与常规的Funqy AWS Lambda集成相比，这种方法确实会增加开销，而且还需要使用AWS API Gateway。"

"The Funqy HTTP + AWS Lambda binding is not a replacement for REST over HTTP.  Because Funqy\n"
"needs to be portable across a lot of different protocols and function providers its HTTP binding\n"

"JAX-RS, Spring MVC, or Vert.x Web Reactive Route xref:amazon-lambda-http.adoc[support] instead.  They also work with Quarkus and AWS Lambda."
