"Quarkus provides form based authentication that works in a similar manner to traditional Servlet form based auth. Unlike\n"
"traditional form authentication, the authenticated user is not stored in an HTTP session, as Quarkus does not provide\n"
"clustered HTTP session support. Instead, the authentication information is stored in an encrypted cookie, which can\n"
"be read by all members of the cluster (provided they all share the same encryption key)."

"The encryption key can be set using the `quarkus.http.auth.session.encryption-key` property, and it must be at least 16 characters\n"
"long. This key is hashed using SHA-256 and the resulting digest is used as a key for AES-256 encryption of the cookie\n"
"value. This cookie contains an expiry time as part of the encrypted value, so all nodes in the cluster must have their\n"

"For that reason, using custom exception mappers to customize authentication exceptions thrown by such mechanisms is not recommended.\n"
