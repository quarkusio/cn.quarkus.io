"An HTTP user agent, such as a web browser, uses an `Authorization` header to provide a user name and password in each HTTP request.\n"
"The header is specified as `Authorization: Basic <credentials>`, where credentials are the Base64 encoding of the user ID and password joined by a colon, as shown in the following example."
msgstr "HTTP 用户代理（如网络浏览器）使用 `Authorization` 标头在每个 HTTP 请求中提供用户名和密码。标头指定为 `Authorization: Basic <credentials>` ，其中凭据是用户 ID 和密码的 Base64 编码，用冒号连接，如下例所示。"
