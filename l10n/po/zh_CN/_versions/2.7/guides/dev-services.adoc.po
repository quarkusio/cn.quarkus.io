"Quarkus supports the automatic provisioning of unconfigured services in development and test mode. We refer to this capability\n"
"as Dev Services. From a developer's perspective this means that if you include an extension and don't configure it then\n"
"Quarkus will automatically start the relevant service (usually using https://www.testcontainers.org/[Testcontainers] behind the scenes) and wire up your\n"
"application to use this service."
msgstr "Quarkus 支持在开发和测试模式下自动配置未配置的服务。我们将此功能称为开发服务。从开发者的角度来看，这意味着如果你包含了一个扩展但没有配置它，那么 Quarkus 将自动启动相关服务（通常在幕后使用 link:https://www.testcontainers.org/[Testcontainers] ），并连接你的应用程序以使用该服务。"

"in most cases this is not necessary as simply configuring the service will result in the Dev Service being disabled automatically."
msgstr "所有这些功能都是 Quarkus `deployment` 模块的一部分，因此不会对生产应用程序产生任何影响。如果你想禁用所有开发服务，可以使用 `quarkus.devservices.enabled=false` 配置属性，不过在大多数情况下这并不是必须的，因为只需配置服务就会自动禁用开发服务。"
