" When running in dev and test mode these resources are hidden from the ClassLoader, when running in production mode these files are removed from the jars that contain them.\n"
" Note that if you want to remove a class you need to specify the class file name. e.g. to remove `com.acme.Foo` you would specify `com/acme/Foo.class`.\n"
