msgid "When you run `mvn compile quarkus:dev` {project-name} will launch in development mode. When it receives a HTTP request it will hold the request, and check to see if any application source files have been changed. If they have it will transparently compile the changed files, redeploy the application with the changed files, and then the HTTP request will continue to the redeployed application. {project-name} redeploys are much faster than a traditional app server, so for all but the largest applications this should take well under a second."
