msgid "{project-name} is not just about being great for writing Web Applications or Micro-Services. We're focusing on more than the feature set: we make sure that every feature works well, simply, with little to no configuration, in the most intuitive way possible. It should be trivial to develop simple things, and easy to develop the more complex ones."

Not only that, but we've made sure that every configurable option has the most useful and sensible defaults so you can get started with no configuration whatsoever."

msgid "When you run `mvn compile quarkus:dev` {project-name} will launch in development mode. When it receives a HTTP request it will hold the request, and check to see if any application source files have been changed. If they have it will transparently compile the changed files, redeploy the application with the changed files, and then the HTTP request will continue to the redeployed application. {project-name} redeploys are much faster than a traditional app server, so for all but the largest applications this should take well under a second."

We will work hard to trim that particular feature to its most useful essence, and to document it thoroughly, in an intuitive manner. That's analysing up-front how to best use that feature and helping you avoid that analysis, through our experience, and guiding you in what we think is the best way to do things. That's taking an opinion on how you should do things and voicing it."
