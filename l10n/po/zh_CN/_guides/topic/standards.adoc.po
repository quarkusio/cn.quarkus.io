Instead, {project-name} provides leading frameworks and technologies from open source projects, such as https://vertx.io[Vert.x], https://camel.apache.org[Camel], http://hibernate.org[Hibernate] and https://resteasy.github.io[RESTEasy]. You can also find innovative community projects, such as https://smallrye.io[SmallRye]. If you are looking for standards you can find https://microprofile.io[MicroProfile] and selected specifications from https://jakarta.ee[Jakarta EE]."
