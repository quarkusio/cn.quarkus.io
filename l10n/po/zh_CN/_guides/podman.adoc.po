"Podman supports two modes of operation: rootful, in which case the container runs as root on the host system, and rootless, where the container runs under a standard Unix user account.\n"
"On Linux, the REST API Unix socket is, by default, restricted to only allow the root user to access it.\n"
"This prevents someone from using a container to achieve a privilege escalation on the system.\n"
"While these restrictions can be softened to allow a special group instead of just root, the recommended approach is to use rootless Podman on Linux.\n"
"To use rootless Podman, you need to set a `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable to point to the user-specific socket."
