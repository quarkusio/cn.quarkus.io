"There are often initialization tasks performed by Quarkus extensions that are meant to be run once.\n"
"For example, Flyway or Liquibase initialization falls into that category. But what happens when the scaling\n"
"needs of an application requires more instances of the application to run? Or what happens when the application\n"
"restarts ?"

"A common environment where both of these cases are pretty common is Kubernetes. To address these challenges,\n"
"Quarkus allows externalization of such tasks as Kubernetes https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/[Jobs] and uses https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/[init containers] to ensure that an\n"
"application instance only starts once the initialization jobs have finished. With this approach even if an\n"
"application has multiple replicas, the initialization logic will only run once."
