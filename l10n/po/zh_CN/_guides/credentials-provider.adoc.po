"Those credentials will allow the client to be identified, authenticated and eventually authorized.\n"
"Username/password based authentication is very common, but that is not by any means the only one.\n"
"Such credentials information may appear in the application configuration,\n"
"but it is becoming increasingly popular to store this type of sensitive information in secure stores,\n"
