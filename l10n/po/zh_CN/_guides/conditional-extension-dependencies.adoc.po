msgid "Quarkus extension dependencies are usually configured in the same way as any other project dependencies in a project's build file, for example the Maven `pom.xml` or the Gradle build scripts. However, Quarkus also supports types of dependencies that aren't supported out-of-the-box by Maven and Gradle. Conditional Quarkus extension dependencies is one such example."

#: _guides/conditional-extension-dependencies.adoc
msgid "A conditional dependency is a dependency that is activated only if a certain condition is satisfied. If the condition is not satisfied then the dependency **will not** be activated. In that regard, conditional dependencies can be categorized as optional, meaning they may or may not appear in the resulting dependency graph."

#: _guides/conditional-extension-dependencies.adoc
msgid "A typical example of a conditional dependency would be a component that should be added to the classpath **only** in case all of its required dependencies are present on the classpath. If one or more of the component's required dependencies aren't available, instead of failing, the component should simply not be added."
