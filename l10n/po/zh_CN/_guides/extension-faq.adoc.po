" For example, plain libraries can create new configuration elements and register classes with Jandex (this link:https://www.loicmathieu.fr/wordpress/en/informatique/quarkus-tip-comment-ne-pas-creer-une-extension-quarkus/[blog shows how])."

"The reason is that _all_ Quarkus's bytecode transformations are done after Jandex indexing. This means changes are never reflected back in Jandex."

#: _guides/extension-faq.adoc

"Most extensions use Jandex as a source of truth to find out what to do. Those extensions won't see new/modified endpoints in the bytecode itself.\n"
"The solution to this limitation is annotation transformers. You should also be aware that while Arc and Quarkus REST honour annotation transformers, not all extensions do."
