msgid "An HTTP user agent, such as a web browser, uses an `Authorization` header to provide a user name and password in each HTTP request.  The header is specified as `Authorization: Basic <credentials>`, where credentials are the Base64 encoding of the user ID and password joined by a colon, as shown in the following example."
msgstr "一个HTTP用户代理，如网络浏览器，使用一个 `Authorization` 标头，在每个HTTP请求中提供一个用户名和密码。该头被指定为 `Authorization: Basic <credentials>` ，其中凭证是用户ID和密码的Base64编码，由冒号连接，如以下例子所示。"
