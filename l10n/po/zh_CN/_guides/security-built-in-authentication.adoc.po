msgid "Quarkus provides form based authentication that works in a similar manner to traditional Servlet form based auth. Unlike traditional form authentication, the authenticated user is not stored in an HTTP session, as Quarkus does not provide clustered HTTP session support. Instead, the authentication information is stored in an encrypted cookie, which can be read by all members of the cluster (provided they all share the same encryption key)."
msgstr "Quarkus提供基于表单的认证，其工作方式与传统的Servlet基于表单的认证类似。与传统的表单认证不同的是，由于Quarkus不提供集群的HTTP会话支持，被认证的用户不被存储在HTTP会话中。相反，认证信息被存储在一个加密的cookie中，集群中的所有成员都可以读取（只要他们都共享相同的加密密钥）。"

#. type: Plain text
#: upstream/_guides/security-built-in-authentication.adoc:64
#, fuzzy
msgid "The encryption key can be set using the `quarkus.http.auth.session.encryption-key` property, and it must be at least 16 characters long. This key is hashed using SHA-256 and the resulting digest is used as a key for AES-256 encryption of the cookie value. This cookie contains an expiry time as part of the encrypted value, so all nodes in the cluster must have their clocks synchronized. At one minute intervals a new cookie will be generated with an updated expiry time if the session is in use."
msgstr "加密密钥可以使用 `quarkus.http.auth.session.encryption-key` 属性来设置，它必须至少有16个字符长。这个密钥使用SHA-256进行散列，产生的摘要被用作对cookie值进行AES-256加密的一个密钥。这个cookie包含一个过期时间，作为加密值的一部分，所以集群中的所有节点都必须同步其时钟。如果会话正在使用中，每隔一分钟就会生成一个新的cookie，并更新其到期时间。"

msgid "Note that if proactive authentication is in use accessing the `SecurityIdentity` is a blocking operation. This is because authentication may not have happened yet, and accessing it may require calls to external systems such as databases that may block. For blocking applications this is no problem, however if you have disabled authentication in a reactive application this will fail (as you cannot do blocking operations on the IO thread). To work around this you need to `@Inject` an instance of `io.quarkus.security.identity.CurrentIdentityAssociation`, and call the `Uni<SecurityIdentity> getDeferredIdentity();` method. You can then subscribe to the resulting `Uni` and will be notified when authentication is complete and the identity is available."
msgstr "请注意，如果正在使用主动认证，访问 `SecurityIdentity` 是一个阻塞操作。这是因为认证可能还没有发生，访问它可能需要调用外部系统，如数据库，可能会阻塞。对于阻塞式应用程序来说，这没有问题，但是如果你在一个反应式应用程序中禁用了认证，这将会失败（因为你不能在IO线程上进行阻塞操作）。为了解决这个问题，你需要 `@Inject` 一个 `io.quarkus.security.identity.CurrentIdentityAssociation` 的实例，并调用 `Uni<SecurityIdentity> getDeferredIdentity();` 方法。然后，你可以订阅产生的 `Uni` ，当认证完成和身份可用时，你将得到通知。"
