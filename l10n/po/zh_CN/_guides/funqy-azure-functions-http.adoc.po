msgid "The Funqy HTTP + Azure Functions binding is not a replacement for REST over HTTP.  Because Funqy needs to be portable cross a lot of different protocols and function providers its HTTP binding is very minimalistic and you will lose REST features like linking and the ability to leverage HTTP features like cache-control and conditional GETs.  You may want to consider using Quarkus's JAX-RS, Spring MVC, or Vert.x Web Reactive Route xref:azure-functions-http.adoc[support] instead.  They also work with Quarkus and Azure Functions."
